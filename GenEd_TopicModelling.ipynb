    "*** \n",
    "To do extract topics from the syllabus documents. A total of 21 course syllabus documents are being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be performing Topic Modelling using Latent Dirichlet association (LDA) and Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "BiGram and TriGram Topic Modelling will also be done using LDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyLDAVis Library will be used for the purposes of visualisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see the topics, top words within those topics and the top subjects under the topics. We will also see the topic distribution within the subject documents as each syllabi will conist of a combination of topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Library used for Topic Modelling: SkLearn as it gave better results than Gensim, others on our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is Topic Modelling:\n",
    "- Topic modeling is a statistical model to discover hidden semantic patterns in unstructured collection of documents. Large collection of documents are represented in terms of topics and topics are represented in terms of words. This Top-Down approach will help in exposing hidden insights from the corpus. In this approach, every document is a distribution of topics and every topic is a distribution of words. The topics extracted using Topic modeling are collection of similar words. The intuition behind Topic modeling is built on top of mathematical framework, which is based on probability and statistics of words in each topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)?\n",
    "- Non-Negative Matrix Factorization is a statistical method that helps us to reduce the dimension of the input corpora or corpora. Internally, it uses the factor analysis method to give comparatively less weightage to the words that are having less coherence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some Important points about NMF:\n",
    "1. It belongs to the family of linear algebra algorithms that are used to identify the latent or hidden structure present in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It is represented as a non-negative matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It can also be applied for topic modelling, where the input is the term-document matrix, typically TF-IDF normalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. NMF has become so popular because of its ability to automatically extract sparse and easily interpretable factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is Latent Dirichlet association (LDA)?\n",
    "- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a popular topic modeling technique to extract topics from a given corpus. The term latent conveys something that exists but is not yet developed. In other words, latent means hidden or concealed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The topics that we want to extract from the data are also “hidden topics”. It is yet to be discovered. Hence, the term “latent” in LDA. The Dirichlet allocation is after the Dirichlet distribution and process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This process is a distribution over distributions, meaning that each draw from a Dirichlet process is itself a distribution. What this implies is that a Dirichlet process is a probability distribution wherein the range of this distribution is itself a set of probability distributions!\n",

You will NOT be \\nallowed in the classroom without a face covering.   \\nYou don’t need to wear your mask when meeting me online. \\nRANGER RESTART \\nPlease see the Ranger Restart page for information on (1) Your  UW-P COVID Responsibility Pledge, (2) UW-P COVID \\npolicies, (3) UW-P disciplinary measures for failing to follow UW-P COVID policies, (4) FAQs, (5) COVID resources, (6) what \\nto do if you get COVID, and (6) UW-P COVID updates.  \\nCOURSE OBJECTIVES AND GOALS \\nWhat makes anthropology unique among the social sciences is that it stands at the \\ncenter “… of the sciences and humanities in its global perspective, its attention to \\nthe past and the present, and its commitment to both research and practice.” \\n- \\nAmerican Anthropological Association, Mission Statement, 2011 \\nThis course is designed to introduce you to the basic principles and concepts of anthropology and its four subfields — \\nPhysical/Biological, Archaeology, Socio-Cultural and Linguistic.  You will learn about various biological and cultural aspects \\nof humankind, both past and present, by drawing from current perspectives used in the field of anthropology today.  The \\ngoal of this course is to provide you with a better understanding of the differences and similarities that exist among human \\nsocieties and cultures of which they are a part.  I use lecture, power points, films, and various activities to illustrate ideas \\nand to serve as topics for discussion.  Your grades will be based on your performance in two non-cumulative exams, four \\nwritten assignments, two reflective essays, and participation in online discussions and activities.   \\nDIVERSITY & INCLUSION \\nThe University of Wisconsin-Parkside is dedicated to a safe, supportive and non-discriminatory learning environment and to \\na safe and supportive classroom regardless of race, ethnicity, ability, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual \\norientation, religion, age, immigration status, and other affiliations. Our university is committed to student excellence as \\nwell as promoting an inclusive campus climate in order to close equity gaps in the areas of student accesses, retention, and \\ndegree completion. \\nIn short, you are welcome here. \\nREAD AND UNDERSTAND THIS SYLLABUS! \\nThe Syllabus is a contract.  In it, I have stated what you need to do to pass this class. By staying in \\nthis class, you have agreed to these terms. They are not negotiable later in the semester. \\n \\nRemember – many of your questions are answered here in the syllabus. Help each other out – if you know \\nthe answer to someone’s question, answer it! It will make the other student feel much better.  \\n \\n3 | P a g e  \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 1. R.I.P. GRUMP CAT \\nWHAT YOU MUST DO TO PASS THIS COURSE \\n• KEEP UP WITH THE READING!  There is no way around this! Do all of \\nthe readings each week.  I write my lectures and plan activities assuming \\nyou did the reading.  If you did not understand something, then ask \\nabout it in the Discussions.   \\no \\nI cannot, myself, raise every important thing. Your job is to \\nfigure out what is important from the textbook.   \\no \\nAnd to answer that eternal question: Yes, you will be tested on \\nit, even if it wasn’t in lecture.   \\n• STUDY FOR THE EXAMS!  Studying is a continual process in college, not \\njust the night before the exam. You can do well if you have kept up with \\nthe reading, watched the lectures and films, taken your own notes on \\nthe lectures and films, participated in discussions, and generally paid \\nattention. You should review your notes and readings at the end of each \\nmodule and subject. You will also find it useful to review the Discussions \\nbefore each exam. This reinforces the information in your mind so that \\nyou can move on to the next days of material with clear understanding (or at least good questions \\nabout what you did not understand).  If you find it difficult to study, there are resources on campus to \\nhelp you learn how to study.  I can help you with that, too.   \\n• \\nWRITE THE ESSAYS WITH THOUGHTFULNESS and \\nsubmit them in on time.  Proof-read your essays; essays with \\ntext-speak, misspellings, typos, and grammatical mistakes \\nmake a poor impression.  You need to make a point and \\nprovide evidence for your point. College is an opportunity to \\nmake yourself into a better communicator.  Make the effort \\nnow.  See Rubrics (below) for more information on what you \\nneed to do in your writing assignments.  \\n• \\nVisit the course site several times a week! New \\nmaterial will come up under Content; participate in the Online Discussions, share ideas with other \\nstudents; and let me know right away if there’s a problem.   \\n \\nThis Photo by Unknown Author is licensed \\n4 | P a g e  \\n \\n• \\nRemember: YOU have to do the work to pass this class, but our university has resources available to \\nhelp you do well. Doing well in college is about learning how to learn, not about knowing everything \\nalready. Good learners know how to assess what they need to learn! \\nGRADES \\nI calculate your grade for the course based on four Writing Assignments, a Reflective Essay, three Exams, and Online \\nParticipation.   \\nYour grade will be based on: \\nActivity \\nPoints \\n% \\nWriting Assignments (4 out of 5) and 2 Reflective Essays \\nEach WA (total of 4 out of 5) worth 10 points each; Reflective \\nEssays (total of 2) worth 10 points each \\n60 \\n40 \\nExams  \\nEach Exam (total of 3) is worth 20 points each. Exams are not \\ncumulative \\n60 \\n40 \\nParticipation (Discussion Forums) \\n30 \\n20 \\nTotal \\n150 \\n100 \\n \\nThe Course Grading Scale is: \\nPercent \\nLetter Grade \\nPoints \\n(approximate) \\n93-100% \\nA \\n150-139 \\n90-92% \\nA- \\n138-135 \\n87-89% \\nB+ \\n134-130 \\n83-86% \\nB \\n129-124 \\n80-82% \\nB- \\n123-120 \\n77-79% \\nC+ \\n119-115 \\n73-76% \\nC \\n114-109 \\n70-72% \\nC- \\n108-105 \\n67-69% \\nD+ \\n104-100 \\n60-66% \\nD \\n 99-90 \\n59 and under \\nF \\n 89-0 \\n \\n5 | P a g e  \\n \\n \\nWRITING ASSIGNMENTS (WA) AND REFLECTIVE ESSAYS \\nEach Writing Assignment is worth 10 points, for a total of 40 points. Each Reflective Essay is worth another 10 points. In \\ntotal, this writing is 40% of your final grade.  \\nREFLECTIVE ESSAYS \\nYou will write one beginning and one final reflective essay of 700-750 words. The first Reflective Essay will be about your \\nassumptions about anthropology and the concept of culture.  It requires you to think about what you do know, what you \\ndon’t know, and how you know it.  The final Reflective Essay reflects on your learning throughout this course. You will \\nconsider the total range of topics, concepts, ideas, and facts you learned in this class and write about one major theme that \\nhas impressed or influenced you.  Trace out how you learned about that theme throughout this class.  \\nThe goal of reflective essays is for you to both examine your own knowledge and learning process as well as to cite back to \\nthe specific information you are or have acquired in this course. This is called metacognition and is a key skill to making \\nyourself a better lifelong learner.  \\n• \\nThe first Reflective Essay is due on September 9th by 8 am. We will discuss it in the Discussions on preceding days \\nto prepare you.         \\n• \\nThe second Reflective Essay is due December 13th at 8 pm. It will help you to review the whole sweep of material \\nin this class and reflect on how much you learned.   \\nWRITING ASSIGNMENTS \\nI assign five short writing assignments; you will write four of these (and only 4 – the 5th is a make-up for students who had \\nto miss a previous writing assignment).  Each essay should be about 650 words long – and not less!  That’s about two \\ndouble-spaced typewritten pages.  You must hand these in before I release the lecture for the week.   \\nWHY?  Writing is an essential part of learning.  If you can describe something in your own words, then \\nyou know it.  It helps you to think about the key points of the readings instead of getting bogged down in \\na hodgepodge of details, that is, it will help you see the forest through the trees.  One of the most \\nimportant skills you will learn in college is the ability to communicate.  If you can write clearly and to the \\npoint, you will have greater success in your future life – you’ll get grants for your project, your boss will \\nlike your reports, and people will like to read your blog.  You will be persuasive.  \\nGOAL:  Your goal for these assignments, therefore, will be to do the reading, think about the question I have set for you, \\nfigure out what the answer needs to be, and write a short essay that concisely and comprehensively answers the question. \\nThese are fact and content based writing assignment. \\nThe essays are due: \\n• \\nWA 01: September 30th by 8:00 am \\n• \\nWA 02: October 14th at 8:00 am   \\n• \\nWA 03: October 28th at 8:00 am    \\n• \\nWA 04: November 11th at 8:00 am   \\n• \\nWA 05 (make-up): December 2nd at 8:00 am     \\nYou will do 4 out of these 5 writing assignments. The make-up is only for those who missed an earlier essay.  Make a note \\nof the due dates. It is your responsibility to remember when papers are due.  \\nEach Writing Assignment is available about 5 days before they are due and they are due before I release a lecture of that \\ntopic.  I will not distribute them early; they are based on cumulative knowledge from the course, so you will not be ready to \\n6 | P a g e  \\n \\nanswer them accurately ahead of time. These essays must address the topic in context. You must read the complete reading \\nassignment before answering the essay question.  If you want to get ahead on the assignments, do the reading ahead of time!  \\nSubmit your assignment in .doc, .docx, or .rtf format.  If you use a different format for writing your paper, use the “save as” \\ndialog to save your file as an .rtf (rich text format) file.  Do not submit it as a pdf. You will flunk if you submit using a format \\nother than the .doc, .docx, or .rtf format. These are readable by almost any program.  \\nI return your papers to you on Canvas, with comments typed in.  Read these comments; they will help you write \\nincreasingly better essays by telling you what I am looking for.   \\nREAD THIS CAREFULLY: You do not learn the ideas and details if you simply copy what’s in the textbook. Therefore, \\nyou will receive no credit for an assignment if you copy from the textbooks or any other source and fail to put it in \\nquotation marks and note the page number in parentheses. That is plagiarism (see more below).  Feel free to work \\nwith other students but share ideas, not your paper.  \\nRUBRICS FOR WRITING ASSIGNMENTS AND ESSAYS \\nGRADING of Writing Assignments:  I grade your essays on a holistic scale from A to F, based on:  \\n• \\nThe organization of your essay; \\n• \\nThe accuracy of the details you use in the essay; those details must also be appropriate (relevant) to the point \\nyou are making; \\n• \\nYou demonstrated understanding of and thinking about the ideas in the readings for class; and \\n• \\nYou have applied the concepts to specific examples from the reading or from your own experience. \\n• \\nYou have written an essay that is uniquely yours – your reflections, your organization, your insights – based on \\nthe evidence presented in the reading. You do not paraphrase a couple of paragraphs, changing a few words \\nor the order of some phrases.  \\n• \\nSee Appendix 2. Detailed Rubrics for more information  \\nNote: You will need to read my comments on your Reflective Essay or previous Writing Assignment (01) before you can \\nsubmit your next Writing Assignment (02). I write comments on right on your digital paper, so you can read it all easily \\n(there are various ways to access this – go to Grades and click the doc icon; or go to Assignments and click the link for that \\nassignment). I will tell you if you missed any significant points in your paper, how you made a good argument or failed to \\nmake a good argument, and some comments on how to write better – in short, I give each of you personalized tutoring in \\nyour papers. I do this to help you do better, not to criticize you! One of my life goals is to make ALL of my students into more \\neffective writers. Yeah, it’s weird, but I am a nerd. \\nEXAMS & QUIZZES \\nYou will have three exams.  Your exams will be online. They will be 35 multiple choice questions. Each exam will be available \\nfor a period of 36 hours, but you will have only 45 minutes in which to do the test.1 Once you sign on to take the test, the \\nclock starts ticking. Plan your time accordingly.  Make sure that you have a reliable internet connection, save your answers \\noften (every page), and do not forget to submit when you are done (the test asks you multiple times if you are really done \\nand want to submit, so make sure you click yes each time Canvas asks you if you are done!). Do not attempt to take the test \\non your phone; Canvas exams are not optimized for phones and you won’t be able to see the entire sentence of each \\nquestion. \\n \\n1 Students with accommodations from Disability Services – we can meet or you can email me with your \\ndocumentation. I can extend the time available to you to take the exam – extending the entire time of availability \\nrequires a different technological approach (which I can do, no problem, but I need to know well ahead of time). If \\nI have any questions, sometimes I like to meet with you and Dr. Kirby or others in her office. It helps me to do the \\nbest for your learning! \\n7 | P a g e  \\n \\nThe exams are not cumulative.  However, doing well on each test requires that you understood and comprehended the \\nmaterial for previous segments of the class.   \\nEach exam will count as 20 points, for a total of 60 points, which is 40% of your final grade.   \\n• \\nThe First Exam will be available from 12 am on October 7th to noon on October 8th       \\n• \\nThe Second Exam will be available from 12 am on November 4th to noon on November 5th     \\n• \\nThe Third Exam will be available from 12 am on December 11th to noon on December 11th       \\nEXAM RUBRICS \\nThe tests draw from the textbook, lectures and films. The main goal of tests is to see if you have learned the key concepts \\nand how to apply them, as well as showing familiarity with key evidence presented in the textbook, lectures, and films. I \\nfocus on your knowledge of concepts and demonstrating how they work. I might ask you about an example of a particular \\nconcept we discussed; or for example of how a particular process works; or about correlations between one set of traits \\nand another set of traits. Each question could require that you understand the concept and what it means, how \\nphenomena work; or recognize patterns.   \\n \\n \\nOf course, tests are stressful. Some of you might have faced a lifetime of stress over tests, feeling insecure and like you are \\nbeing judged. Here’s a useful resource for helping get better at testing: \\nK-State: “I know the material, but when I take the test I go blank!”: http://www.k-\\nstate.edu/counseling/topics/stress/strestst.html  \\nQUIZZES \\nIn Modules where you do not have a writing assignment or reflective essay due, I post an online quiz. These quizzes are \\nformative assessments, meaning I use them to assess what people in the class in general do and do not understand. You \\ncan take them as many times as you like. When you submit the quiz, scroll down past the “you submitted successfully” \\nmessage to see which questions you got wrong, so that you can re-study those points in the textbook and discuss them in \\nthe Discussions. \\nThese quizzes also help to prepare you for the exams, which are graded. Such pre-tests have been shown to greatly \\nimprove student comprehension and retention. My observation over the semesters is that students who re-do these \\nquizzes and discuss the quizzes on the Discussions achieve higher grades on the graded exams.  \\nDISCUSSIONS \\nWe will definitely go all online after Thanksgiving Break. Depending on circumstances, we might go all online for periods of \\ntime before that.  If that happens, we’ll make use of the Discussions in Canvas to replace class discussion. \\nAs you will learn in this class, humans are evolved to be social – even the most introverted among us (and I am an extreme \\nintrovert) learn in social settings.  In an online class, we don’t get to see each other, to chat and exchange information; you \\ndo not have the chance to informally ask me about a point from the reading or lecture before or after class. We can use \\nDiscussions to re-create this kind of social interaction. \\nWe will use these Discussions to share ideas, reactions, and content.  Participation in Discussions in this class is two-tiered. \\nYou have to put up a first post by a particular time and a reply to someone else’s post within a designated time. You can \\nalways post more!  \\n8 | P a g e  \\n \\nDISCUSSION RUBRICS \\nI grade you on participation. However, your participation must be sincere, to the point (responding to the readings and to \\nother comments) and take into account the ideas and information learned in this class. What you post in the Discussions \\ndoes not necessarily need to be right, but it needs to be engaged, thoughtful, and help us all to move the conversation \\nforward.  Respectfully express your opinions and the basis for those opinions (facts!) to me and your classmates. Relate it to \\nthe subject (anthropology) as you are learning about it. Be brave – write about what excited you, what confused you, the \\nmuddy points, the highlights.  \\n• \\nYou must post at least one post in each forum. It must be at least 125 words long. This post must be substantive – \\ndeal with content. For instance, when discussing results of the quizzes, don’t just write ‘this quiz was harder than \\nthe others because it was not so straightforward and I had to think about 2 different things to answer the \\nquestions.’ That’s not about content. Rather, be specific. What things? Did you have trouble with the difference \\nbetween bridewealth and dowry? Between phenotype and genotype? Talk about that.   \\n• \\nYou must respond to at least one post in each forum. This response must be substantive. Extend the conversation, \\nask a question (ask the original poster to expand on or clarify something), disagree with their interpretation (not \\nwith them personally!), or just help out another student by answering their question! Make it at least 75 words.  \\n• \\nI grade Discussion postings on the combination of consistent presence (posts and replies) and evidence of \\nengaging with the class material (textbook, lectures, films) in your postings – the kind of ideas you consider, how \\nyou go about understanding new concepts, your ability to give evidence to support your statements (page \\ncitations!) – how helpful you are to others, and just plain being engaged with the material. \\n• \\nYes, I do notice when you post late, and when you post and reply within a few minutes of each other. In fact, I can \\nsee how many posts you have read. I definitely take this into account in grading your active and sincere \\nparticipation in the Discussions.  \\nSTANDARDS FOR PARTICIPATION \\nThe study of anthropology raises many issues about life in the world today, and we will discuss those issues in on the \\nDiscussions.  Some of what we discuss might excite or frustrate or anger you.  Good – be passionate!  But keep your \\ninteractions polite and on topic.  Peter Connor (see Canvas home page) suggests these ground rules for Online Discussions. \\nI have paraphrased them for our setting.  \\n• \\nParticipate: For the maximum benefit to all, everyone must contribute. We all learn if we participate.  \\n• \\nReport Glitches: There will be glitches. Report them right away to the Help desk (262/595-2444 or \\nservicedesk@uwp.edu). If it is Canvas related, check the Knowledge Base (kb.uwp.edu) first. Also let me know. I \\ncan’t fix it, but I should know if there’s a problem so that I can adjust timelines if necessary.  \\n• \\nHelp Others: You might have more experience with online Discussions than others in the class. Give them a hand. \\nShow them it’s not so hard. They’re really going to appreciate it! Similarly, be willing to ask for and receive help if \\nyou need it.  \\n• \\nRead Thoroughly and Respond: There’s no need to repeat what others are saying. Rather, expand the discussion.  \\nAcknowledge the points made with which you agree and suggest alternatives for those with which you don’t. \\n• \\nBe Brief: You want to be clear—and to articulate your point—without being preachy or pompous. Be direct. Stay \\non point. Don’t lose yourself, or your readers, in overly wordy sentences or paragraphs. \\n• \\nUse Proper Writing Style: This is a must. Write as if you were writing a term paper. Use correct spelling, grammar, \\nand sentence structure. This is not the place for text-speak. Please refrain from c u l8r’s. Emoticons and clip art \\nmight be useful, however.  \\n• \\nCite Your Sources: This is really important. We might all have different interpretations of the reading in the \\ntextbook. Cite the page number for your information (Kottak, p. 211) so that others can find where you are. That \\nway, we’re really talking to a point instead of talking at cross-purposes. In addition, if you use any other sources in \\nyour discussion, properly cite it. Give those authors credit for their work and allow others to find it as well.   \\n9 | P a g e  \\n \\n• \\nRespect Diversity: We live in rich and diverse multi-cultural world. Use no language that is—or that could be \\nconstrued to be—offensive toward others. Don’t be derogatory or sarcastic to others; do not denigrate their faith, \\nethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, disability or age. Remember – sarcasm does not come across well in print.  \\nRather, focus on understanding or figuring out what’s hard to understand about someone’s viewpoint. We all have \\ndifferent viewpoints. Our job here is to understand it and then take that as a path to understanding human \\ndiversity in general.  \\n• \\nNo YELLING!  Using bold upper-case letters is bad form, like stomping around and yelling at somebody (NOT TO \\nMENTION BEING HARD ON THE EYE). \\n• \\nNo Flaming! No tantrums, no rants, and no profanity. Write criticism that is constructive, well-meaning, and well-\\narticulated. When you disagree, say why and back it up.   \\n• \\nLastly, Remember: You Can\\'t Un-Ring the Bell. Language is your only tool in an online environment. Be mindful. \\nHow others perceive you will be largely—as always—up to you. Once you\\'ve hit the send button, you\\'ve rung the \\nbell. Read and re-read your post before posting.  \\nLATE AND MAKE-UP POLICY AND THE GOLDEN TICKET \\n• \\nWriting Assignments and Reflective Essays: I deduct an entire grade for each day that a written assignment is late \\nstarting from the moment it was due.  I continue to take another point off for each day after that your assignment \\nis late.  After four days, it’s an automatic zero.  \\n• \\nBut that’s not The End! Remember, I’ve set this up for you to do only 4 out of the 5 Writing Assignments. That \\nmeans that if you’re unable to do one of the essays, you still have a chance to make that one up later in the \\nsemester. \\n• \\nThe Reflective Essays tend to be a lot less stressful, so being late won’t be a problem. However, remember \\nthat the 2nd RE is at the end of the semester. I have to get grades in. If you know you can’t do it, then you \\nneed to talk to me about taking an Incomplete.   \\n• \\nJust for This Semester. Still and all, it might be a difficult for semester.  So, I’m making available to you One \\nGolden Ticket. You can use your Golden Ticket to hand in any writing assignment or essay late, no \\nquestions asked and no points taken off.   \\n• \\nExams: There’s no need for make-up exams because you will have access to each exam for 36 hours.  IF you have a \\nserious personal emergency, then you must email me immediately. There are administrative processes we can use \\nto help you handle serious emergencies (see below).  \\n• \\nDiscussions. Discussions are closed to postings at the end the specific times noted for each Discussion. You will be \\nable to read the discussion threads but not post to them after they are closed. I can’t re-open them for just one \\nperson – it’s technologically impossible.  \\n• \\nNo Extra Credit: If your grade is low, do not ask for extra credit to make your grade higher.  If you are not doing a \\ngood job on the required work, you will not suddenly do better by taking on more work for extra credit.  In college, \\na good grade is not about racking up points, but about working towards better understanding. Similarly, the final \\n(make-up) Writing Assignment is not for extra credit. I will read and grade it only if you missed one of the earlier \\nWriting Assignments.   \\n• \\nSometimes your entire semester ends up a massive non-stop emergency. Remember – it is better to \\ndrop your semester than to just quit working on your classes. Those get you Fs and Academic Probation or \\nSuspension. If you need help, let me know, speak to your advisor, or contact the Dean of Students (Steve Wallner, \\n262-595-2598), or the Vice Provost of Student Affairs and Enrollment Services (Tammy McGuckin, 262-595-2598). \\nFor counselling, be sure to contact Student Health, Counseling and Disability Services.  \\n10 | P a g e  \\n \\no If you have a learning disability: You can reach Disability Services at 262-595-2372 or via email \\nkirby@uwp.edu.  You can also contact We can help you strategize to save your semester and even \\nnavigate the paperwork for a medical withdrawal. Our goal is to make sure that you can keep on track \\nonce you have dealt with the emergencies. Keep your eye on the end game.   \\no TALK TO ME – Let me know if things are getting impossible for you so that I can put you in touch with \\nthe people who can help you if you need to withdraw, or need counselling, or whatever!  \\nCHEATING POLICY \\nCheating: Cheating includes getting the answers to the quizzes/exams from some place other than your own knowledge in \\nyour own head, and plagiarism. \\nLooking up the answers in the textbook or online when you are taking the test is cheating. I have set up the test to \\nmake that very difficult to do. There simply isn’t enough time. Either you know it or you don’t. Do not use the \\nglossary, don’t use your textbook, don’t use your notes. Cheating also includes taking the test with a friend or \\ngetting a friend to give you their answers. Don’t “ask a friend” or classmate. You are on your honor in this, but \\nknow that it is cheating. \\nBe aware that I use a large database of constantly changing questions and each exam is randomized so that none \\nof you will have the exact same test.  \\nPlagiarism: When you submit other people’s work as your own, it is called plagiarism. Plagiarism means using someone \\nelse’s words or ideas as your own.  For instance, if you find a web site with information about the essay topic and you copy \\nsome of the phrases, sentences, or paragraphs into your essay, that is plagiarism.  It is theft of someone else’s ideas, \\nthoughts, and the way they wrote them. This is a serious offence and can get you kicked out of school. Writing is not a \\nmusical mash-up (and even mash-ups credit the original songs and artists); you must find your own words, not merge \\ntogether others’ words.   \\nAnswer the writing assignments with your own thoughts in your own words.  Responses that are copied from some other \\nsource (e.g., a textbook, a web site, encyclopedia, Wikipedia, another student in class) are plagiarism and will receive NO \\nCREDIT.  A rule-of-thumb is if you use more than three words from another source (a book, an article, a lecture), you must \\ncite it! If you do not, it is plagiarism and plagiarism is cheating.  \\nAll students should be aware of university regulations regarding such cheating.  Plagiarism constitutes academic \\nmisconduct and there are specific university rules for dealing with it (See Student Academic Disciplinary Procedures, \\nChapter UWS 14).   \\nIf you have questions about whether something is plagiarism, please check with me.  Professional academics discuss this \\nwith each other, so there’s no reason why you shouldn’t, too!  So long as you acknowledge that an idea or information is \\nnot your own and give the original source, and so long as your work contains enough original work in addition to whatever \\nyou quote from others, you will not have plagiarized. So learn how to paraphrase. And learn how to cite! \\n11 | P a g e  \\n \\n \\nSanctions for Plagiarism and Cheating \\nAll are a form of dishonesty. So just don’t, ok? \\nPlagiarism: If I find even small portions of un-referenced \\nsentences or information in your papers, I will take your \\ngrade down severely. If I find that you have plagiarized a \\nsubstantial portion of your paper, I will flunk you for that \\nassignment. If you do this more than once in my class, \\nyou could flunk the course.  And you could be kicked out \\nof school.   \\nI also inform the Dean of Students. I know you’re \\nstressed. I know time is short. But don’t take this ‘out.’ It \\nmeans you get nothing from your college education.  \\nExams: If you are caught cheating on an exam you will receive 0 points (an F) for the exam. You may also be referred to the \\nUniversity for additional Sanctions, which may include suspension or expulsion. Cheating includes any form of sharing any \\nkind of information with test-takers while taking the exam; or sharing information after you have taken the exam with \\nsomeone who has not yet taken it. Be aware that I use various forms of randomization to ensure that none of you has the \\nexact same exam.  \\nAnd yet … I encourage you discuss the quiz responses. The point there is to learn through crowdsourcing. However, talk \\nabout the content, not “the answer to Question 2 is A.” That won’t be correct anyhow, because I randomize answers! \\nPlease ask me if you have any questions about what constitutes cheating or plagiarism.  \\nAND  \\nI make these materials available to you under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non-\\ncommercial-Sharealike 4.0 License.

WHY TAKE A GEN ED? COMPETENCIES \\nCOMPETENCIES YOU WILL ACHIEVE \\nANTH 100 will help you to achieve a number of competencies set by the General Education and the Geography and \\nAnthropology programs.  \\n \\n \\nGENERAL EDUCATION \\nThis class fulfills the GENERAL EDUCATION SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE requirement.  \\n \\nThese skills are key to your future job advancement and satisfaction.  Learn these now, where teachers like me are here to \\nhelp you learn and improve these basic skills. You can learn technical content through your major, but learning these ‘soft’ \\nskills is what GenEds are for – and it’s what employers want because they don’t train people in these skills. \\nCOMMUNICATION \\nLiteracy – reading for understanding and writing for effective communication. \\nYou have to learn how to read and write effectively, or you will likely fail your college \\nclasses AND you will not be prepared for the workplace. All of you need to be able to \\nwrite, at least, short reports, letters, and proposals.  \\nYou will learn how to read at a college level through reading the textbook for this \\nclass. You will learn how to pick out key concepts and supporting evidence, as well as \\nhow these kinds of knowledge fit together to make an argument. It is difficult to read \\ntextbooks straight through, word-by-word. Pay attention to the outline at the beginning of the book and as you read think \\n“how does this relate to the main concepts being taught in this chapter?” Pay attention to the headings and keep track of \\nwhere you are in the chapter’s outline. DO read the inset boxes, they are interesting!  \\nThis Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA \\nThis Photo by Unknown Author is \\n14 | P a g e  \\n \\nYou will also learn how to do college-level writing.  You will learn how to summarize the key concepts in your own words; \\nselect and present evidence (data) that illustrates or proves these concepts; how to write concise analyses based on the \\nreading; and how to write a summary overview. \\nACTIVITIES: All Reading, the Writing Assignments (WA), the Reflective Essays (RE), and a variety of online activities – for \\ninstance, getting your point across in the Discussions will depend on you being able to write clearly. \\nREASONED JUDGEMENT  \\nCritical Thinking – applying logic and reasoning to problem solving.  \\nYou learn Critical Thinking skills in Anthropology because you will need to learn to question \\nyour own unexamined assumptions in order to make sense of how other people live. You \\ncannot assume you understand other ways of life are similar to what you know, but this \\ngoes beyond your lived experience, so it takes some work to let go of our inherent \\nassumptions about the world, beliefs, social roles, and relationships. To do this, you need \\nto consciously think about difference – including how our lives in the US are different.   \\nYou will learn to think about the concepts and what they mean in practical terms, \\nparticularly how to apply them to the evidence in the textbook, lectures, discussions, and \\nyour observations of the world around you.  To do this, you need to be aware of your own \\npre-existing assumptions and test whether the data (from the book or lecture) either supports or disproves your \\nassumptions.  \\nThis General Education Competency is related to the Anthropology Competencies of Understanding the impact of the social \\nand physical environment on individual experience, and Demonstrate the connection between theory, methods, and \\nrealities.  \\nACTIVITIES: Exams and Writing Assignments, Reflective Essays, and Discussion.    \\nSOCIAL AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY \\nGlobal Perspective – acquiring the knowledge and skills that provide an understanding of international/global issues and \\nprocesses \\nA major goal of the class is to understand the range of diversity among \\nhuman groups in the world, both today and in the past. This includes \\nunderstanding the historical and social reasons for differences among \\npeople, and to understand how we ourselves fit into the world’s cultural \\ndiversity. You will demonstrate this in exams and writing assignments as \\nwell as a variety of class activities. It also requires that you recognize that \\nyou, yourself, are part of a global system and, furthermore, that your \\nperception of this is altered by ethnocentrism – the human tendency to \\ndefine and judge others according to our own standards. These are \\ncultural standards, they are specific to this time and place. Therefore, \\nmuch of the class will be oriented toward helping to become aware of \\nyour unexamined assumptions.   \\nThis General Education Competency relates to Anthropology Competencies of Demonstrating an understanding of cultures \\nand societies in their own terms, Identify and confront ethnocentrism, and Use anthropological knowledge to address \\nimportant issues locally and globally.   \\nThis Photo by Unknown \\nThis Photo licensed under CC BY \\n15 | P a g e  \\n \\nACTIVITIES: Readings, Lectures/Films, and Reflective Essays as well as Discussion and other class activities.   \\nGEOGRAPHY AND ANTHROPOLOGY \\nThe Geography and Anthropology Department has identified a set of competencies for its courses.  Introduction to \\nAnthropology is designed to address the following competencies. In many cases, these overlap with the General Education \\ncompetencies. \\nKNOWLEDGE \\n• \\nComprehending the interrelationships between the environment/nature and \\nhuman activities. In anthropology, we focus on \\no \\nUnderstanding the impact of social and physical environment on individual \\nexperience \\no \\nDemonstrating an understanding of cultures and societies in their own terms \\nThis means that you will learn to think holistically, in terms of how different \\nelements of society are interconnected and that difference is patterned, not \\njust random; you will learn cultural relativism, understanding cultures in \\ntheir own terms, as they really are, rather than in terms of our own culture’s \\nideas of what is good and right.  \\nYou will demonstrate these competencies in the Exams and in the Writing Assignments, and especially the Final \\nReflective Essay.  \\nANALYTICAL AND TECHNICAL SKILLS \\n• Our goal is to train students to use a variety of tools to make sense of data. For \\nanthropology, we particularly focus on: \\no Understanding the different kinds of data that the fields of anthropology use, \\nand how we gather those data \\no Demonstrating an understanding of the concepts we use to analyze those \\ndata, and what this proves or does not prove \\no Explaining the underlying premises of these methodologies \\no In anthropology, a key premise is understanding ethnocentrism and cultural \\nrelativism \\nThis is key to all kinds of knowledge you accomplish in university. You need to \\nrecognize that concepts are different from the details or evidence, and learn how \\ndifferent fields of study use different methods to get data; and that the same data can be analyzed in terms of different \\nconcepts.  \\nEthnocentrism is judging other people according to one’s own cultural standards. As humans, we all do this; we \\ncategorize other people according to what we know. But we can learn how to recognize that we are doing this. This \\nallows us to address important local and global issues much more effectively. Being aware of our own biases \\nimproves communication and helps us get to resolution of problems. We will examine many of examples of these \\nthroughout the class. \\nYou will demonstrate these competencies throughout your participation in the Discussions and in your writing, particularly \\nin RE 01, WA 03, and WA 04.  \\nThis Photo by Unknown Author is \\n16 | P a g e  \\n \\nCOMMUNICATION \\n• \\nThe goal is for you to develop critical thinking skills to solve \\nproblems, including presentation of the results.  In this class, we \\nparticularly focus on \\no \\nUsing anthropological knowledge to address important \\nissues locally and globally \\n \\nThis is a civic value. We all need to be able to carefully observe \\nthe world, analyze data and review our knowledge, then be able \\nto present those findings to others in ways that they will \\nunderstand.   \\nYou will demonstrate these competencies in discussion \\nand exercises, as well as several of the Writing Assignments, such as 03, 04, 05, and both Reflective Essays.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n17 | P a g e  \\n \\nAPPENDIX 2. DETAILED RUBRICS \\nThese are some of the points I will note in my comments on your essays. Make sure your writing assignment includes: \\nCONTENT \\n• \\nThe paper \\no \\nAddresses the topic or question \\no \\nAccurately presents the evidence in the textbook (Kottak, for the Writing Assignments) or shows careful thinking about \\nwhat you know and what you have learned (Reflective Essays) \\no \\nProvides enough evidence from the textbook to support your arguments (Writing Assignments) or gives relevant \\nargument and description that illustrate your points (Reflective Essays) \\nSTRUCTURE \\no \\nThe introduction \\n▪ \\nIs present at the beginning of the paper \\n▪ \\nIs a clearly stated thesis \\no \\nThe body \\n▪ \\nContains complete discussion and support \\no \\nEach paragraph \\n▪ \\nIncludes a topic sentence \\n▪ \\nDevelops one main idea \\n▪ \\nHas a transition sentence linking it to the next paragraph \\no \\nThe conclusion \\n▪ \\nRecaps your main point (NOT new information!) \\nORGANIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT \\n• \\nThe entire composition \\no \\nIs logically organized \\no \\nHas a solid statement with supporting evidence \\n• \\nMain points \\no \\nAre relevant to the thesis \\no \\nAre discussed without repetition \\nSTYLE \\n• \\nIs concise and precise \\n• \\nHas correct spelling and grammar \\n• \\nHas complete sentences \\n• \\nHas subject/verb agreement \\n• \\nUses pronouns correctly \\n• \\nIs free of jargon and clichés  \\n• \\nCites references correctly \\nCITATIONS \\no \\nIn anthropology, we use Chicago Style in-text citations.  At the end of the sentence we put the name of the author, the \\nyear the article or book was written, and the page number like this in parentheses: (Jones 1998, 98).  The period comes \\nafter the citation. Then put all of the reference information about the article or book at the end of your essay, like this: \\nJones, Elena A.  I learned how to write well in school. Vanity Fair Magazine (May):97-99.  1998.  \\n \\no \\nFor this class, you will be citing Kottak. In this class, just cite (Kottak, page#), like this (Kottak, 94).  I know which work by \\nKottak you are using. Note that the period comes AFTER the citation. The citation is part of the sentence. Here’s an \\nexample from a student paper: \\nCeremonies such as baptisms, weddings, and bar/bat mitzvahs can change the status of an individual, \\nmarking that they have been through the necessary process (Kottak, 476). \\n18 | P a g e  \\n \\nPlease spell Kottak’s name correctly.  \\n',\n",

If you decide to drop a class, you \\nmust do this by notifying the Student Records Office directly. Pay attention to these important \\ndates: \\nFebruary 12, last day to drop a course without paying drop fee \\nFebruary 16, last day to drop a course without receiving a “W” on your transcript \\nMarch 19, last day to drop a course through SOLAR. \\nApril 23, last day to drop a class with signed authorization from Instructor, Department Chair, \\nand College Dean.  Signed authorization is granted only for extraordinary, non-academic, \\ncircumstances.  You cannot drop a course after April 23 because you do not like the grade you \\nare earning. \\n \\nGrades: \\nYour grade will be determined by:  \\n1) Attendance/Participation = 10%,  \\n2) 3 online monthly exams or weekly quizzes and one online cumulative final exam = 30% \\n(15% monthly exams or weekly quizzes; 15% for final exam),  \\n3) NYT or Science Magazine readings = 30%, and \\n4) MindTap activities = 30%. \\nLetter grades will approximate: A 93-100%; A- 90-92%; B+ 87-89%; B 83-86%; B- 80-82%; C+ \\n77-79%; C 73-76%; C- 70-72%; D 60-69%; F < 60% \\n \\nAttendance/Participation: Class attendance of all lectures is important to understand the course \\nmaterial. Class attendance will be monitored.  Every lecture has a series of questions that are \\nembedded in the lecture, and students must listen to the lecture to answer them. In addition, a \\ndiscussion will be set for discussion of lecture materials and/or materials from the New York \\nTimes. Formal excuses are granted only under certain extenuating circumstances. To be formally \\nexcused, students must provide the instructor with official documentation that confirms the \\nextenuating circumstance. (For example: All medical excuses must be accompanied by an \\nofficial doctor’s note stating that the student is unable to take the exam for the time period in \\nquestion. Letters from friends or family members are NOT considered official documentation.) \\n \\nQuizzes/Tests and Exams: The tests will consist of true-or-false/multiple choice questions. \\nQuestions are based on material covered in lectures, assigned videos, and assigned readings. The \\nlast of the four exams will be comprehensive. You have a choice of using either the weekly \\nquizzes/tests or monthly exams; this is to accommodate a bad day, forgotten assignment, or \\ntechnological glitch. Because of these inherent leniencies, there is no make-up quiz or exam. \\n \\nThe New York Times and Science Magazine in the Classroom: The New York Times is available \\nONLINE for free to you.

You are welcome to call or stop by my \\noffice any time, but the best option is to make an appointment as I am often in other meetings. \\n \\n \\nClass Materials  \\n\\uf0b7 The Student Companion to Community-Engaged Learning: What you need to know for \\ntransformative learning and real social change by David Donahue and Star Plaxton-\\nMoore (2018). \\n\\uf0b7 Online readings, films and videos posted on Canvas \\n \\nCourse Overview and Learning Objectives \\n \\nThis community-based learning (CBL) course is designed to prepare you for learning in \\ncommunity environments both on and off campus, and to be engaged as a local and global \\ncitizen. We will explore the questions: \\n\\uf0b7 What does it mean to be a community-engaged citizen?  \\n\\uf0b7 Why is it important to be aware of social issues? \\n\\uf0b7 How can I seek active ways to effect change?   \\n \\nThis introductory course will weave together readings, film, discussion, writing, guest speakers, \\nand, most importantly, 15 hours of volunteer service in a local community organization. In the \\n2 \\n \\nprocess, your understanding of civic and community engagement will be heightened through \\nthinking, speaking, and doing and, ultimately, through critical reflection and communication. \\n \\nCBL 101 – Introduction to Community Engagement fulfills the General Education requirement \\nin Social Sciences. It also is a core requirement for the Community Engagement Certificate.  \\n \\nCommunity-Based Learning Objectives: \\n \\nThis is a designated Community-Based Learning (CBL) course. You will apply classroom \\ncontent in real-world settings in collaboration with a community partner. Meaningful community \\nexperiences integrated with instruction and reflection enrich the learning experience, teach \\ncivic responsibility, and strengthen communities. Students in this course will achieve these \\noutcomes: \\n\\uf0d8 Discern and identify different theoretical perspectives and apply them to community \\nexperiences and social realities; \\n\\uf0d8 Provide a service to community partners in Kenosha, Racine, Milwaukee, or other \\nneighboring counties through a specific and tangible task; \\n\\uf0d8 Enable active citizenship and effective teamwork through application of knowledge and \\norganizational process; \\n\\uf0d8 Develop an awareness of issues of diversity and its application to academic curriculum \\nand community engagement;  \\n\\uf0d8 Reflect on career and personal opportunities for community engagement; \\n\\uf0d8 Gain knowledge about various community members and agencies. \\n \\nThis course meets the following Community Engagement Certificate outcomes: \\n\\uf0d8 Use effective, inclusive communication methods to promote civic action in local, national \\nand/or global contexts. \\n\\uf0d8 Demonstrate ongoing social and personal responsibility to promote civic action. \\n\\uf0d8 Connect and extend classroom learning to engagement outside the classroom.  \\n\\uf0d8 Promote inclusive engagement with diverse communities and cultures. \\n \\n \\nGeneral Education (Social and Behavioral Science) Goals: \\n \\nThis course also represents a General Education Breadth of Knowledge requirement under the \\narea of Social and Behavioral Sciences. General Education goals emphasized by competency \\narea are: \\n \\n \\nCommunication \\n \\n> Oral communication – listening, speaking and presenting effectively \\n \\n \\nReasoned Judgment \\n \\n> Ethical thinking – recognizing and analyzing ethical issues and actions \\n \\n \\nSocial and Personal Responsibility \\n \\n> Civic Engagement – using knowledge and skills to contribute to the community \\n3 \\n \\n> Social Equality – understanding and questioning the social, political, economic,  and \\nhistorical conditions that construct social equality \\n \\nLearning and Assessment \\n \\nThe University of Wisconsin-Parkside has established “community engagement” as one of its \\nhallmarks. The University is one of a small number of institutions in the country to achieve the \\nCarnegie Foundation’s classification of “Community Engagement” in large part because of the \\nnumber of courses that engage students in community experiences. This course is designed to \\nprepare students for learning and serving in community environments and to be engaged local \\nand global citizens. Students will develop a personal plan to make a contribution to a public \\nissue and integrate it into their academic experience.  \\n \\nDuring the semester, students will be exposed to current issues and complexities facing our \\nsociety. Students will learn about these issues from an academic disciplinary perspective, and \\nwill be exposed to a variety of community-based efforts designed to address a particular issue \\nthrough direct action. Students are expected to explore one issue in depth through an \\nexploratory service project. During the semester, students will be exposed to and be given \\nexperiential opportunities in the following social issues: \\n\\uf0b7 Race, Ethnicity and Gender \\n\\uf0b7 Poverty \\n\\uf0b7 Educational Achievement Gaps and Mentoring \\n\\uf0b7 Environment and Sustainability \\n\\uf0b7 Community and Organizational Development \\n\\uf0b7 Building Social and Economic Capital \\n \\nAssessment in this course is based on the learning associated with community experience, not \\nsolely for the service that a student provides.  When working in the community it is important \\nfor students to remember that they not only represent themselves, but also UW-Parkside as a \\nwhole. Students are expected to act in a professional manner and should plan to invest at least \\n15 hours in an exploratory service project. Exploratory service projects involve an on-site \\noverview of a local community agency and a community service for the agency (the instructors \\nwill provide an overview of agencies and projects). This experience is like an “alternative text” \\nfor the course – discussions and assignments will draw from both the students’ experiences in \\nthe community and the reading materials. Course requirements related to reading and other \\nassignments have been adjusted appropriately. \\n \\nClass Participation: I believe that learning is based on effective communication.  As such, \\nclass participation is a vital component of this course. Students will be expected to participate \\nin each class. This also means that you must come to class prepared, having done all \\nassignments and assigned readings for that day, by the start of class. Excessive absence or \\nlateness will result in a deduction of class participation points. Attendance is expected and will \\nbe taken daily. \\n \\n \\n4 \\n \\nWhile your success in this class is your responsibility, I am here to help you, so please \\nask if you need clarification of anything in this syllabus or anything during the course. I \\nlook forward to a wonderful learning experience with you. \\n \\nEvaluation/Grading \\n \\nYour performance in this course will be evaluated using written reflections, a multimedia final \\npresentation, your participation in class and a community-based learning service project.  \\nGrading will be based on the following criteria: \\n \\n \\nClass participation/attendance:   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIncludes engagement in class discussion and activities     \\n \\n \\n 100 points \\nFull points for attendance can only be earned when you are on time, prepared, \\nparticipate and attend the entire class period \\n \\n3-2-1 and other Response Papers \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 50 points \\n \\nPre-service reflection essay  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n       \\n 40 points \\n \\nMid-service reflection essay \\n \\n \\n \\n                  \\n 50 points  \\n \\nCBL Project  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n          100 points  \\n\\uf0b7 \\ncompletion of Work Plan (25 points),  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nverification of 15 service hours (60 points) \\n\\uf0b7 \\nsupervisor evaluation (15 points) \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\nPecha Kucha presentation \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n            60 points  \\n \\nFinal reflection essay \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n            50 points \\n \\n \\n \\nTotal possible points:         450 points \\n \\n \\nThe final grade will be based on the following scale: \\n \\nA:  92 - 100 %;  A-:  90 - 91 %  \\nB+:  88 - 89 %;   B:  82 – 87 %;   B-:  80 - 81 % \\nC+:  78 - 79 %;   C :  71 – 77 %;   C-:  69 – 70 % \\nD+:  67 – 68 %;   D:  59 – 66 %;   D-:  57 – 58 % \\nF:  Below 57 % \\n \\nLate work policy: For each day an assignment is past the due date, 10% of the assignment’s \\ntotal points will be deducted, up to 50%.  For example, if an assignment worth 100 points is \\ndue on Tuesday and you turn it in on Thursday, the most points you could earn would be 80 \\n(20% off, two days late).  \\n \\n \\n \\n5 \\n \\nClassroom Policies  \\n \\n1. \\nOut of respect and courtesy to others in the class, please arrive on time.    \\n2. \\nStudents are required to come to each class session prepared and ready to discuss \\nthe assigned material. \\n3. \\nPlease come to class with an open mind and a willingness to share your thoughts with \\nothers.

If you have not been placed into \\nMATH 111 or higher, you should not take this course until the math skills requirement has been satisfied. If \\nyou have not taken a chemistry course before, you may want to take CHEM 100 instead, which will prepares \\nyou for CHEM 101. \\n \\nCourse Overview and Goals:   \\nThis is the first semester of a two semester sequence that introduces students to the fundamental concepts and \\nprinciples of chemistry. Through CHEM 101, students will be able to describe/identify: \\n(1) the fundamental building blocks of chemical systems (atoms, ions and molecules),  \\n(2) variables that define chemical systems,  \\n(3) reactions that simple systems can undergo,  \\n(4) quantitative relations of chemical reactions, and \\n(5) the electronic structures of atoms and chemical bonding. \\nGeneral Education Learning Outcomes:   \\n \\nChemistry 101 is a general education course in natural sciences and addresses the following goals and \\noutcomes: \\nCommunication: Literacy–reading and writing for understanding and effective communication. \\nLearning Outcome: Students will (1) comprehend vocabulary appropriately to summarize or paraphrase the \\ninformation, (2) apply knowledge to a variety of assignments, and (3) identify aspects of a text to respond to \\nquestions posed in assigned tasks.  \\nExpectations: Students are expected to read 30-40 pages per week from the textbook and lab manual.  \\nAssessment:  There will be questions in the homework and exams that require students to comprehend \\nvocabulary, apply knowledge, and identify aspects of the text to respond.  \\n \\nReasoned Judgment: Scientific thinking–understanding and applying the scientific method. \\nLearning Outcomes:  Students can calculate (1) introductory physical and chemical properties for chemicals \\nand chemical systems, (2) stoichiometric measures of chemical systems, and (3) energy relationships in simple \\nchemical systems.  Successful achievement requires the correct analysis of the system to determine the relevant \\nvariables.  \\nExpectations: Skills acquired are (a) recognizes the application of the scientific method in solving \\ncontemporary problems, (b) critically evaluates information and sources, and (c) converts relevant information \\ninto various forms. \\nAssessment:  Scientific thinking is embedded and evaluated in all aspects of Chemistry 101.  \\n \\nSocial and Personal Responsibility: Individual Accountability – understanding what a responsible choice is \\nand that one’s present education and lifelong learning is a responsibility. \\nLearning Outcome: Students successfully fulfills all aspects of the course and meets minimum expectations \\nin problem solving. \\nExpectation:  Student identifies multiple approaches for solving the problem. Student uses skills, abilities and \\ntheories gained in one situation in a new situation to contribute to the understanding of problems or issues. \\nStudents evaluates results relative to the problem defined with some consideration of need for further work.    \\n \\nAssessment:  Individual accountability is embedded throughout the CHEM 101 learning experience.  Lecture \\nexercises will often involve evaluating multiple approaches and will require students to apply prior knowledge \\nto present (new) situations including future (further) steps.   \\n \\nLectures: \\nThere are four 53-minute class periods per week. A lot of material needs to be covered this semester so the \\nlectures will move rather quickly. In order to get the most out of the lectures, you should (1) read the topic to \\nbe covered before the lecture, (2) do not hesitate to ask/help answer questions, and (3) actively participate in \\nthe lecture discussion, and (4) you are responsible for obtaining notes and materials from missed classes. \\n \\nGrading Scheme: \\nTop Hat Preview: 25 points       \\nTop Hat Homework: 60 pts \\n \\nParticipation (clicker): 40 pts \\nLecture exercise: 30 pts   \\nLecture quiz: 25 pts \\n \\nIn-class exams: 300 pts   \\nFinal exam: 120 pts \\nApproximate scale (%): A/A-: 90-100; B+/B/B-: 80-89, C+/C/C-: 70-79, D+/D/D-: 60-69, F:<60.

There will be NO makeup exams. \\nThe exam dates are highlighted in the schedule \\n \\nFinal Exam: Tuesday, Dec. 10, 10:30 AM-12:30 PM, comprehensive. \\nAcademic Misconduct:  \\n \\nAcademic misconduct is a violation of the UW-Parkside student conduct code. Academic misconduct is \\nunacceptable for students and for instructors in this professional development training. Plagiarism or \\ncheating of any form will result in failure of the assignment or exam, and may include harsher sanctions. \\nYou can visit the Office of Student Affairs, http://www.uwp.edu/live/offices/studentaffairs/ if you have \\nquestions about plagiarism or cheating incidents. I encourage you to discuss any concerns regarding \\nplagiarism or cheating with me directly and well before any assignment is handed in. Failure to understand \\nwhat constitutes plagiarism or cheating is not a valid excuse for engaging in academic misconduct.  \\n \\nClassroom Civility: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nCome to class on time. Do not pack up belongings before class ends as it is disruptive to others.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nTurn off all electronic devices that might create a disruption in class. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nBe quiet and give full respectful attention while either instructor or another student is speaking. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nMindless talking during class is immature and inconsiderate behavior. Please ask questions or make \\ncomments about the class material that will benefit the entire class, but leave the chit-chat in the halls \\nwhere it belongs. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nClassroom discussion should be civilized and respectful to everyone and keep comments and questions \\nrelevant to the topic at hand. \\n \\nGeneral Chemistry Study Tips: \\n In the past, many students have relied solely on lecture attendance to learn the material. However, it often \\nleads to a poor grade in the class. To be successful in this course, it is essential to review and work on \\npractice problems daily. Exams will test both conceptual understanding as well as quantitative \\nmanipulations. Practice will build the required critical thinking and problem solving skills required on the \\nexams. Specific steps: \\n1. Read the course material before lecture. \\n2. Attend every lecture, discussion, and laboratory. Take good notes. \\n3. Review course material, notes, and start working problems as soon as possible after lecture and you \\nhave reviewed the relevant material. \\n4. Read the textbook carefully. Work through example problems and sample exercises. Make notes on \\nmaterial that you want to ask questions about later. \\n5. The best way to prepare for Chemistry exam is to work problems thoroughly and being able to \\nsolve other problems without having to refer to the notes or the text. Do not look at the solution or \\nexample for guidance unless you have worked on it for a while!  \\n6. Make use of the office hours and other tutoring services. Instructors are here to help. Come prepared \\nwith specific questions. Do not wait until the last minute to clarify points. \\n7. Start to prepare for exams as early as possible. Keep your notes organized and constantly review \\nmaterial. Make index cards with important formula or information for review. \\n8. Study, study, and more study. You should spend about 2 - 3 hours of study time per lecture hour. \\nPlan to spend about 6-9 hours on general chemistry each week. \\n \\nAcademic Dishonesty: \\n \\nCheating or disruptions in the classroom will not be tolerated.  Any attempts to cheat on examinations or \\nquizzes will result in a zero for that exam (or quiz), and possibly an “F” for the course, depending on the \\nseverity of the cheating.   \\n \\n \\nWeapons Policy \\nWeapons are prohibited in UW-Parkside building and all outdoor events.  Anyone found in violation will be \\nsubject to immediate removal in addition to academic and/or legal sanctions.  \\n \\nADA/504/Student Services: \\nIt is the University’s policy to provide, on a flexible and individual basis, reasonable accommodations to \\nstudents who have documented disabilities that may affect their ability to participate in course activities or to \\nmeet course requirements. Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact Disability Services for a letter \\nof verification to provide to their instructors.

You are strongly encouraged to take your notes! \\n \\nCourse Overview \\nA student successfully completing this course will have a proficiency in basic chemistry.  This \\nproficiency will include understanding scientific measurements and the scientific method, the proper \\nreporting of data, the structure of atoms and molecules, the importance of the electron, types of \\ncompounds, nomenclature, and understanding the differences between inorganic and organic \\ncompounds, acids and bases.  Upon successful completion of Chemistry 100, students may continue their \\nchemistry education by enrolling in either Chemistry 101 or Chemistry 115.   \\n \\nChemistry 100 also counts towards completion of the General Education Requirement in the \\nNatural Sciences.  The purpose of the general education program is to insure that all graduates possess \\ngood communication skills, problem solving skills, and social and personal responsibility.  This course \\nspecifically addresses the following learning outcomes: \\n \\nCommunication:  Literacy \\n Literacy is defined as reading for understanding.  Literacy involves the correct usage of terms; \\nadvanced literacy is the presentation of new ideas in a clear and concise manner including supporting \\nevidence.  Chemistry 100 involves both beginning and intermediate literacy.  Students will be expected \\nto correctly use “new” terms and concepts.  This is evaluated in the on-line homework, quizzes, and \\nexams. \\n \\nReasoned Judgment:  Scientific Thinking \\nScientific thinking reflects understanding and applying the scientific method.  Laboratory testing is the \\nbest venue for applying the scientific method so Chemistry 100, no laboratory component, will focus \\non understanding the scientific method in the context of various discoveries.  We will also strive to \\ncreate some dry-lab situations that will allow you to apply the scientific method to propose alternatives.  \\nLastly, you will be tasked to convert relevant information into various forms (charts, graphs, tables, \\nfigures, narrative).  This is evaluated in the on-line homework, report, and exams. \\n \\nSocial and Personal Responsibility:  Individual Accountability \\nIndividual accountability is understanding what a responsible choice is and that one’s present education \\nand lifelong learning is a responsibility.  In this course you will: (a) conduct an introductory evaluation \\nof solutions including history, logic, reasoning, feasibility and impact; (b) apply previous knowledge \\nand skills to demonstrate comprehension and performance in novel situations; and (c) evaluate results \\nrelative to the problem defined with some consideration of need for further work. Individual \\naccountability is embedded throughout all the graded work.  It is highlighted by your perseverance with \\nthe on-line homework and quizzes.  \\n \\nChemistry 100 is a skills class.  Accuracy and speed are essential.  Accuracy and speed are obtained by \\nstudents who work the problems at the end of the chapters and those throughout the chapters.   \\n \\nGrading Scheme: \\nOn-line Homework:  90 pts \\nOn-line quizzes: 50 pts   \\n \\n \\nIn-class exams: 270 pts   \\nFinal exam: 90 pts \\n \\nTotal: 500 pts \\nApproximate scale:  A/A-: 450-500 pts, B+/B/B-: 400-449 pts, C+/C/C-: 350-399 pts, D+/D/D-: 300-\\n349 pts, F: < 300 pts.  The instructor reserves the right to determine a portion of the grade by subjective \\nassessment of overall performance. \\n \\nHomework: Homework will be assigned for each chapter. Each homework is 10 points. You will \\nbe required to work out the homework assignments on OWLv2 system. The due dates will be specified for \\neach chapter and are firm. It is important to complete the homework in a timely manner. The most points \\nawarded will be 90 points. \\n \\nQuizzes: There will be weekly online quizzes (on OWLv2) except during the weeks of exams. Each quiz is \\n7 points (may contain extra points) and covers the materials from the previous week. The quiz will be \\navailable starting on Saturday evenings and end by 11:00 pm on Tuesdays.

Daniel, Introduction to Java Programming, Comprehensive Version, 11th \\nEdition, Pearson Education, Inc. 2018, ISBN-13:  978-0-13-467094-2 \\n \\nCourse Packet: \\n• Please purchase your course pack through the campus bookstore. It contains handouts \\nusually provided in the classroom, including practice problems and exams.  You can \\ncome to the bookstore or arrange with them for the course pack to be mailed to you. \\n \\nPlease note that at the instructor’s discretion, lectures and class sessions may be live streamed \\nand/or recorded and made available to students registered for the class. The use of live streaming \\nand lecture capture is intended to supplement the classroom experience solely for the benefit of \\nstudents registered in the class. UW-Parkside prohibits faculty, staff, and students from copying, \\ndistributing, or using lecture capture recordings for any other purpose; violation of this \\nprohibition may be grounds for UW-Parkside to initiate disciplinary proceedings. \\n \\n \\nGeneral Education Learning Objectives \\nCSCI-241 fulfills a Natural Science General Education requirement. Specifically, it helps \\nstudents achieve competency in the following areas: \\n \\nCommunication: Information Technology Competence - using modern information technology \\nto retrieve and transmit information  \\nLearning Outcomes: \\n1. \\nNavigate online references and apply related material to a program. \\n2. \\nSubmit programming assignments electronically to hand them in. \\n \\nReasoned Judgment: Critical Thinking - applying logic and reasoning to problem solving  \\nLearning Outcomes: \\n1. \\nWrite a computer program to accomplish an assigned task. \\n2. \\nIdentify and correct logic errors in a program to complete the assigned task. \\n \\nSocial and Personal Responsibility: Individual Accountability – understanding what a \\nresponsible choice is and that one’s present education and lifelong learning is a personal \\nresponsibility.  \\nLearning Outcomes:  \\n1. Identify a way to solve a problem and apply previous knowledge and skills to craft a \\nsolution. \\n2. Create test data to demonstrate success. \\n \\nCourse Requirements and Procedures \\n1. Grade Distribution: Your course grade will be calculated using the following distribution:  \\nProgramming Assignments:  \\n25%  \\nQuizzes and CodeLab Exercises:  \\n20%  \\nTwo Midterm Examinations. 15% each:  30%  \\nFinal Comprehensive Examination:  \\n25%  \\nFinal letter grades will be determined using a class curve of the course-grade averages.  \\nNo extra credit is available for improving grades.  \\n \\n2. Exam make-ups: Prior notice must be given to your instructor. No make-ups will be granted \\nwithout satisfactory documentation showing an extenuating circumstance.  \\n \\n3. Grading questions: If you question a grade, see your instructor within one week of the day \\nthe graded work was returned to you. You lose the right to re-grading after that.  \\n \\n4. Incompletes: Incomplete grades (I) are granted rarely, usually in case of medical emergency. \\n \\n5. Absences: You will be expected to “attend” class at the scheduled times within Collaborate \\nUltra in Canvas. Please notify your instructor of any expected absence.  Although attendance \\ndoes not appear in your grade calculation, a good record of class attendance and participation \\nmay help your final grade in borderline cases. Making up material from missed classes is \\nyour responsibility.  \\n \\n6. Course Information: Examples, reference information, lab and assignment-specific \\ninformation will be available on Canvas or from the CSCI-241 course web pages. \\nAnnouncements/clarifications will be posted in Canvas.  \\n \\n7. Academic dishonesty: All coursework should be done individually unless otherwise directed \\nby the instructor. Copying is strictly forbidden. According to the severity of the offense, \\nstudents caught cheating may either share the grade or receive a zero for the assignment. \\nRepeated offenses will result in dismissal from the course and possible disciplinary sanctions \\nby the university.  Academic Misconduct definitions and procedures are covered by UW-\\nParkside Misconduct Policy.  \\n \\n8. Disability Assistance: It is the University\\'s policy to provide, on a flexible and individual \\nbasis, reasonable accommodations to students who have documented disabilities that may \\naffect their ability to participate in course activities or to meet course requirements.  Students \\nwith disabilities are encouraged to contact Disability Services for a letter of verification to \\nprovide to their instructors.  Disability Services is located in WYLL D175 and can be \\nreached at 595-2372 or kirby@uwp.edu (to contact Dr. Kirby). \\n  \\n9. No Food and Drink in Class and Lab: No food or beverages are allowed in classrooms and \\nlabs on campus per “Ranger Restart” guidelines.  \\n \\n10. Cell Telephones/Pagers during class: Such devices are very distracting. Please silence the \\nring tone during lecture time. I expect you will NOT be using your phones during exams. \\n \\n11. Concealed Weapons:  Weapons are prohibited in UW-Parkside buildings and all outdoor \\nevents.  Anyone found in violation will be subject to immediate removal in addition to \\nacademic and/or legal sanctions. \\n \\n12. Accommodation of Religious Observances: UW-Parkside Senate policy requires \\nreasonable accommodation for a student\\'s religious beliefs. Please notify your instructor \\nwithin the first week of classes about any scheduled class date which conflicts with a \\nreligious observance. \\n \\n13. Course Withdrawal: The last day to drop a semester course is Tuesday, October 20, 2020.  \\n \\nLaboratory Requirements and Procedures \\n1. The Computer Science Lab is in MOLN D116. \\n2. Lab Orientation: Each student must activate their Computer Science lab account \\n(instructions provided by our System Administrator, Matt McPherson).  Watch your campus \\nemail for a message from Matt sometime during the first week of classes. \\n3. Assignment Submission: Each programming assignment must be submitted both through \\nyour CS lab account and also in Canvas. See separate document for instructions. \\n \\nComputer Science Lab Use \\nThe Computer Science Laboratory (CS lab) in MOLN D116 holds computer workstations from \\nwhich you can reach your individual lab account.  These workstations are connected via a Local \\nArea Network to a server so you use any of the machines and log in to your own account. These \\nmachines use a version of the Unix operating system called Linux. The prelab 1 handout explains \\nthe basics of Unix. \\n \\nYou must use your Ranger Card to enter MOLN D116. Contact the Ranger Card Desk (in the \\nStudent Center) if you need a card.  \\n \\nYour computer account is your private property and should be treated as such. Keep your \\npassword private and make sure to completely log out every time you use your account. It is your \\nresponsibility to prevent others from plagiarizing your work. \\n \\n \\n \\nDiscussion Section Exercises and Quizzes \\n1. Each week during your discussion section we will go over practice problems.   \\nThese problems are in your course pack. Weekly quizzes will be posted in Canvas. \\n2. Your instructor will drop your lowest quiz score from your final grade. \\nThis course requires a subscription to TuringsCraft CodeLab exercises.  The exercises will be \\nassigned in Canvas. \\nYou can pay for them directly with a credit card ($25 per year) through their website: \\nhttps://www.turingscraft.com/ \\nTo pay using financial aid funding, purchase your subscription through the campus bookstore \\n(slightly higher price). \\n \\nCourse Software \\nMost students install course software on their home computers to write, compile and run \\nprograms. All course software is free.  Download all files from the course web page links. You \\ncan also access the CS lab by using a \"secure shell\" program named ssh. This program encrypts \\nyour data to and from the lab. However, with ssh, you may only be able to use the non-graphical \\nterminal window. You can also use Remote Desktop Login to reach your lab account. \\n \\nAssignment Submission Policy and Guidelines \\n1. You will receive a new programming assignment every one or two weeks. Assignments must \\nbe submitted both in the lab account and uploaded to Canvas. Programming assignments \\nare due at the beginning of class on the assigned due date.  Late assignments are \\npenalized at 20% per calendar day.  Extensions may be granted in rare cases when there are \\nextenuating circumstances (such as serious illness or disability, a death in the family, an \\naccident, etc.) and when these circumstances are supported by written documentation. \\n \\n2. You must electronically submit your programming assignments from your lab account, even \\nthough you may have done the assignments on a different computer.  The submission process \\nthat is set up in the lab copies your files to a special, \"to be graded\" location.

The majority of the course will focus on the practice of modern archaeology, \\nincluding a consideration of field and laboratory methods utilized to recover and analyze \\narchaeological remains, the analysis of archaeological materials and data, and several current topics. \\nWe will also cover a brief overview of world prehistory revealed through archaeology, and we will look \\nat some contributions of archaeology to modern life. Within the Department of Geography and \\nAnthropology, this course is designed to address the following competencies related to the \\nConcentration in Anthropology within the departmental major: \\n \\n \\n1. Knowledge/Conceptual:   \\n \\n \\nc. Apply anthropological concepts and interpretations to the world around us.  \\n \\n \\n2. Methodological/Analytical and Technical Skills:  \\n \\na. Record, interpret, and communicate qualitative and quantitative evidence.  \\nb. Find, organize, and critically evaluate data/information using a variety of tools such as \\nmaps, statistics, and a variety of archaeological and ethnographic methods; as well as \\nanalysis of culture and social relationships.  \\n \\n3. Synthesize and Communicate:  \\n \\na. Demonstrate critical thinking skills to conduct research and solve problems.  \\n________________________________________________________________________________  \\n \\nANTH 201 fulfills a university Social and Behavioral Science Breadth of Knowledge (BOK) \\nrequirement. Specifically, it helps students to achieve and demonstrate competency in the following \\nareas:  \\n \\n A. Communication:  \\n  \\n-Literacy - reading and writing for understanding and effective communication. \\n  \\n \\nThis will be assessed by means of the Feder assignments and in-class exercises.  \\n \\n \\n \\nReading Expectations. For traditional first-year students, new to the discipline/topic, the time  \\n \\n \\nspent per week should be approximately two hours per credit-hour. Therefore for a 3-credit  \\n \\n \\nclass, students are expected to complete 6-hours of reading per week.  \\n \\nIntroduction to Archaeology                                                                                                             2 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nReading Outcomes:  \\n1. Students will comprehend vocabulary appropriately to summarize or paraphrase the information. \\u2028 \\n2. Students will apply knowledge to a variety of reading assignments. \\u2028 \\n3. Students will identify aspects of a text to respond to questions posed in assigned tasks.  \\n4. Comments on texts in ways that preserve the author’s meanings and link them to the assignment.  \\n \\n \\n \\nWriting Expectations: Students will produce written assignments that do the following: 1) demonstrate  \\n \\n \\nattention to context, audience, purpose, and to the assigned tasks; 2) use appropriate content to develop  \\n \\n \\nideas and present information; 3) reflect consistency of organization and presentation; and 4) effectively  \\n \\n \\nuse sources to support ideas in writing.  \\n \\n \\n \\nWriting Outcomes:  \\n \\n \\n1. Students will develop answers to a series of questions posed to them in two in-class exercises, and three  \\n \\n \\n writing assignments related to reading and understanding an assigned case study in archaeology. The  \\n \\n \\n assignments will reflect the four writing expectations outlined above.  \\n \\n \\n \\nAssessment of Reading and Writing: Evidence of the requirement should be measured by three to five  \\n \\n \\nwritten assignments, as well as by the three course exams. There will be questions on the exams and  \\n \\n \\ninvolved in the four written assignments that require students to comprehend vocabulary, apply knowledge,  \\n \\n \\nand identify aspects of the course material and readings to respond. This will be assessed by means of  \\n \\n \\n1) students reading an assigned archaeological case study and effectively presenting answers to a series of  \\n \\n \\nquestions about the relevant material, over three assignments, 2) students completing written assignments  \\n \\n \\nrelated to two in-class exercise, and 3) effectively answering questions related to the course material in the  \\n \\n \\nexams.  \\n \\n B. Reasoned Judgment: \\n  \\n-Critical thinking - applying logic and reasoning to problem solving.  \\n  \\n \\nThis will be assessed by means of the Feder assignment, in-class exercises, and exam  \\n  \\nquestions.  \\n \\n  \\nCritical Thinking Outcomes:  \\n1. Students will analyze, interpret, and synthesize information from multiple relevant and reliable  \\nsources. \\n2. Students will identify their own and others’ assumptions and several relevant contexts when  \\npresenting a position on an issue. \\n3. Students will make conclusions that are tied to a range of information, including alternative  \\nviewpoints. \\n \\n \\n \\nAssessment of Critical Thinking: Evidence of the requirement will be measured by several written \\n \\n \\nassignments, in-class exercise work, and by the three course exams. There will be questions on the exams \\n \\n \\nand involved in all written assignments that require students to conduct critical thinking and respond to \\n \\n \\nquestions in ways that reflect their understanding of the topics, methods, procedures, and results of their  \\n \\n \\nwork. This will be assessed by means of 1) students reading an assigned archaeological case study and  \\n \\n \\neffectively presenting answers to a series of questions about the relevant material, over three assignments,  \\n \\n \\n2) students completing written assignments related to three in-class exercise, and 3) effectively answering  \\n \\n \\nquestions related to the course material in the course exams.  \\n \\n C. Social and Personal Responsibility: \\n  \\n-Teamwork - working effectively with others for a common goal.  \\n  \\n \\nThis will be assessed by means of four special in-class exercises.  \\n \\nIntroduction to Archaeology                                                                                                             3 \\n \\n \\n  \\nTeamwork Outcomes:  \\n1. Students contribute to team meetings and/or efforts by offering suggestions to advance the  \\nwork of the group. \\n2. Students will facilitate contributions by fellow team members by constructively building upon  \\nor synthesizing the contributions of others.  \\n3. Contributes to team climate by means of polite, respectful, constructive, positive, and  \\nencouraging interaction with team members.  \\n \\n \\nAssessment of Teamwork: Evidence of the requirement should be measured by four in-class exercises \\n  \\nrequiring teamwork. One exercise involves examining a set of artifacts to develop an understanding \\n  \\nof the nature and variety of artifact attributes and their respective values. Another involves examining \\n  \\nan ethnographic film to identify aspects of material culture. A third involves undertaking a process \\n  \\nof dating archaeological sites and contexts by means of analyzing simple, everyday artifacts and the \\n  \\ninformation they contain. A final teamwork exercise involves conducting an archaeological survey a \\n  \\nportion of our campus to discover traces of the recent and more distant human past that lie here.  \\n \\n________________________________________________________________________________  \\n \\nRequired Text: \\n \\n Muckle, Robert J.   \\n  \\n2014 Introducing Archaeology.

Our \\nuniversity is committed to student excellence as well as promoting an inclusive campus climate in order to \\nclose equity gaps in the areas of student accesses, retention, and degree completion. We encourage all \\nstudents to familiarize themselves with the available resources and programs in our campus designed to \\npromote inclusion and a welcoming environment as well as providing guidance, assistance, and consultation \\nas needed.   \\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\nWhere to go for help… \\nFree in-person tutors and academic success coaches are available to assist you in the Parkside Academic \\nResource Center (PARC), located at Wyllie D180. Help is available for math tutoring, writing assistance, \\nlearning and study skills, as well as tutoring in many other subjects.  Visit the PARC website for specific \\ncourses and hours. Students who participate in tutoring typically earn higher final course and exam grades \\nthan students who do not participate in tutoring.  Online tutoring is offered by NetTutor, which can be \\naccessed through Canvas.  \\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\nAttendance Policy  \\nStudents are expected to attend all classes. Individual absences from class may be excused only by the \\ninstructor. Consult the course syllabus for proper procedures for notifying the instructor in case of \\nemergency.  \\nUniversity-Sponsored Activities  \\nUW-Parkside, while prioritizing academics, believes in the education of the whole person and affirms the \\neducational value of university-sponsored activities that enhance the educational experience such as, but \\nnot limited to, participation in the performing arts, music ensembles, student government/student leadership, \\nintercollegiate athletics, study abroad, and attendance at professional/scholarly meetings. The UW- Parkside \\nfaculty, staff, students, and administrators work together to reach a compromise that respects both the need \\nfor students to attend class and the benefits of participating in university-sponsored activities that enrich \\nstudents’ educational experiences. In the spirit of these shared values,  \\nit is the responsibility of students to:  \\n• attend classes and complete all assignments according to the expectations of their instructors;  \\n• be aware of the policies of each of their instructors;  \\n• be aware of policies regarding adding/dropping of courses, and withdrawal from the university;  \\n• inform their instructors well in advance of any anticipated absences for university-sanctioned activities;  \\n• maintain communication with their instructors throughout the course;  \\n• arrange to make up missed work in a timely manner at the direction of the instructor;  \\nit is the responsibility of faculty to:  \\n• establish policies that recognize the value of participation in university-sponsored activities, which might \\ninclude flexibility in allowing students to submit assignments or take exams at alternative times or venues;  \\n• provide students their attendance expectations in the syllabus at the beginning of the semester;  \\nit is the responsibility of sponsors of university-sanctioned events to:  \\n• recognize the priority of academics and that some courses are experiential in nature, and therefore do not \\nlend themselves to flexible absence and makeup policies;  \\n• schedule events and travel schedules in such a way as to minimize absences from class as much as \\npossible;  \\n• require students to inform the faculty well in advance of any absences or tardiness;  \\n• offer their assistance in accommodating the needs of students who must submit assignments or take \\nexams. \\n \\nIntroduction to Archaeology                                                                                                             7 \\n \\n \\nMilitary Training \\nIn addition to university-sponsored activities, UW-Parkside recognizes that a number of students are \\nattending classes while serving in the military as active duty servicemembers, National Guard members, \\nreservists, or as members of an ROTC program.  On occasion, these students will be required to miss class \\ndue to military training (these differ from Federal Title 10 Activation or Transfer orders).  It is understood that \\noften times these training obligations are scheduled in advance, while occasionally they are deemed \\nnecessary with little advance notice to our military-connected students.  We also understand that our \\nmilitary-connected students do not have the choice of whether to participate or not in these trainings.  UW-\\nParkside encourages our military-connected students to inform their faculty immediately when they learn of \\nthese obligations for training.  When communicated in advance, these absences should be treated in the \\nmanner described above. \\nWhen disagreements regarding this policy occur between a student and a faculty member, the issue will be \\nfirst referred to the faculty member’s department chair in writing, followed by the college dean, for review and \\nresolution. \\nUpdated September 6, 2018; Approved by Faculty Senate September 18, 2018 \\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\nOther Course Policies, Information, and Suggestions: \\n \\nRegarding Class Attendance:  I expect students to attend every possible class, and be prepared to take \\nnotes on the material we cover. Students are responsible for all material presented in lectures, discussions, \\nfilms, and readings. If you must miss a class, you must obtain the notes from one of your fellow students, as \\nthey are not posted anywhere. If you must miss an exam for a legitimate reason, notify me by email as soon as \\nyou are aware of that fact. Do not wait until after the exam is given to notify me of your absence. Failure to \\nobserve this exam policy will create a significant problem for the student.  \\n \\nUsing Your Textbook:  The textbook chosen for this course is designed to give you an understanding of \\ncourse material and provide additional perspective on the work of anthropologists. Please do not memorize the \\ntextbook, simply read the textbook to help you understand the material. Keep in mind that, while there is \\nsignificant overlap, the textbook is never a substitute for your in-class lecture notes.  \\n \\nCell Phone Policy:  Turn off all cell phones when you enter the class, unless you obtain express permission \\nfrom the instructor for a legitimate reason. Unauthorized use of your cell phone will result in a significant loss of \\ngrade.  \\n \\nTalking or Other Disruptive Behavior:  Talking and/or holding a conversation disturbs your classmates and \\nprofessor, and will result in a substantial loss of grade. If I have to stop my lecture because you're talking, or if I \\nhear from any of your classmates that you've been talking in class, you will lose grade points. On the other \\nhand, if it is obvious to me that you routinely listen and are thinking during the lectures, that counts in your \\nfavor.  \\n \\nSuggestions for How to Succeed in This Course: You are the one individual more responsible than anyone \\nelse for your performance in this class. This is not rocket science. Think. Come to class, pay attention, and \\ntake good notes, preferably by hand.  \\n \\n*****Studies have shown that writing notes longhand allows students \\nto better remember, synthesize, and comprehend course material, \\nwhen compared to using a laptop to take notes.***** \\n \\n \\nThink about the material we've covered and review your notes at least once per week. Do your readings \\nand think about them (again, don't memorize the textbook). Hand in assignments complete and on time, and \\nbe responsible. Use the study guides I provide to follow and organize the key topics, concepts, \\nperspectives, and information presented and discussed in lectures. Come to any office hours to ask any \\nquestions you might have about the material or the course. Do these, and you should do well in this \\ncourse.   \\n\",\n",

Today, many college and post-secondary students are already familiar with \\ncomputers, the Internet and the World Wide Web.  Thus, in this course we go beyond click-here-click-there: \\nwe teach the student to be confident, in-control users of Information Technology (IT).  Students are taught \\nto use IT to solve problems on their own and apply the power of IT to their everyday lives. \\nTopics include: data & program representation, the system unit, the CPU & memory, storage systems, input \\n& output devices, the operating system & utility programs, networking and computer communications, \\ncomputer security and privacy, problem solving techniques and tools, flowcharts, algorithms and basic \\nprogramming. \\nThis course uses a Learning Management System (LMS) to store the course content and navigate the \\nstudent through the course. \\nCourse Values \\nCSCI 105 is a general education course in natural science that emphasizes the following values: \\n• \\nLiteracy: effectively communicating your ability to be an effective user of IT.  This is done through \\nwriting and problem-solving exercises. \\n• \\nCritical thinking: applying logic and reasoning to increase your ability to solve problems.  This is \\naccomplished through writing and problem-solving exercises. \\n• \\nIndividual accountability: understanding what a responsible choice is and that one’s present education \\nand lifelong learning is a personal responsibility.  This is achieved through course deadlines and LMS \\nsubmissions. \\nCourse Purpose \\nThe heart and purpose of this course is threefold: (1) to help students become effective users of IT, (2) to \\nhelp students improve their problem-solving skills and (3) to help students understand how to apply IT \\nknowledge and problem solving to their everyday lives. \\nCourse Outcomes \\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to: \\n(CO-105-001) Identify the components and uses of a computer’s system unit.

Students must purchase their own textbook: textbooks cannot be shared. \\nCourse Website \\nThis course uses a LMS as the main way to access course material and to interact as a class.  Please \\nmake sure that your computer and browser are compatible with the LMS interface.  The requirements for \\nstudents that take online courses can be found here: \\nhttps://www.uwp.edu/explore/offices/campustechnologyservices/ \\ninnovationsinlearning/technology-requirements-for-online-students.cfm \\nIf you have technical difficulties with the LMS, please see this link for details: \\nhttps://www.uwp.edu/explore/offices/campustechnologyservices/innovationsin\\nlearning/canvas-login.cfm \\nOnline Structure \\nThe content of this course is designed to be the equivalent to a face-to-face (f2f) course.  You should expect \\nto spend a similar amount of time being involved with this course and its assignments as you would in a f2f \\ncourse even though we do not have regular class meetings. \\nOnline courses vary in how they are structured and in the use of deadlines.  There will be strict deadlines \\nfor this course.  You may complete assignments early, but you are not allowed to turn in assignments or \\ntake quizzes late.  In plain words, late material is not accepted.  Extensions may be granted in rare cases \\nwhen extenuating circumstances (like serious illness or disability, a death in the family, an accident, etc.) \\nexist, and are supported by written documentation. \\nCourse deadlines are dependent on when the student takes the course.  The box below describes the \\ncourse deadline structure for Fall/Spring and Summer/Winterm. \\nFall/Spring \\nThe following deadline structure applies to a course offering in the Fall or Spring semesters only. \\nThe deadlines for modules are posted in the LMS and have specific due dates.  The deadlines for \\nthe course are on a weekly basis.  All activities are to be completed weekly unless documented \\notherwise. \\nSummer/Winterm \\nThe following deadline structure applies to a course offering in the Summer or Winterm semesters \\nonly. \\nThe deadlines for the course are done in “checkpoints”.  Every three to four weeks, a checkpoint is \\nperformed by your instructor.  The checkpoints are posted in the LMS and have specific due dates.  \\nThe purpose of the checkpoint is to ensure the student is “caught up” and on track for course \\ncompletion.  All readings, videos, quizzes and assignments must be completed by the checkpoint.  \\nWhile checkpoints are every three to four weeks, it is NOT recommended that the student wait \\nuntil the checkpoint to perform all of the modules.  The recommended methodology is to \\nperform one module per week – this will distribute the work load over an acceptable period of time. \\n \\nVersion 4.0.0 \\nCSCI 105 - Introduction to Computers :: Online Course Syllabus \\nPage 4 of 5 \\n \\nEach week, you will be expected to perform a number of activities based on the course content.  The \\nactivities include but are not limited to: \\n• \\nReading(s).  You are to read the assigned reading material.  The reading material will be from the \\ntextbook as well as custom material not found in the textbook.  Students are responsible for all \\nreading material within covered chapter(s)/readings unless instructed otherwise.  If the reading is \\na chapter from the textbook, the end of each chapter contains “Review Activities” which you are \\nexpected to complete.  Do the “Key Term Matching”, “Self-Quiz” and “Exercises” activities.  The answers \\nto the “Review Activities” are in the study guides for each chapter.  The completed “Review Activities” \\nwill not be handed in.  However, this material tends to show up on exams.  It is very important to \\ncomplete these assignments as they demonstrate proficiency with the material discussion in the section. \\n• \\nVideo(s).  You are to watch the assigned videos.  These videos parallel and expand on the textbook \\nmaterial. \\n• \\nDiscussion.  You are to participate in the weekly discussion.  These discussions explore areas not \\nspecifically addressed in the readings or videos and expand on topics related to ethics in computing and \\nthe future of computing. \\n• \\nQuiz.  You will be required to take an on-line quiz that deals with the textbook material as well as any \\nadditional reading material that was assigned.  Quizzes are open book (you are encouraged to use the \\nbook and readings!) with no time limit (other than the due date) but you are allowed only one \\nsubmission.  This quiz is to be completed before the due date shown in the schedule.  Quizzes cannot \\nbe “made-up”.  If you miss a quiz without prior approval by the instructor, you will receive a grade of 0 \\n(zero).  NO EXCEPTIONS! \\n• \\nAssignment.  You are to perform the assignment.  The assignment parallels the current problem-\\nsolving material and is based on the custom course material not found in the textbook.  All assignments \\nwill require a written discussion and/or documentation.  Written material is required to be in digital form.  \\nHandwritten submissions are not acceptable unless specified in the assignment.  Since all word \\nprocessors have a means to do so, all written assignments must be submitted as a Portable Document \\nFormat (PDF).  This is the only acceptable format for which submissions will be accepted unless stated \\notherwise in the assignment description.  You will then be expected to submit your Problem-Solving \\nAssignment to the course LMS before the time shown in the LMS, unless directed to do otherwise. \\nEvery activity has an “Activity Checklist” that goes along with it.  The Activity Checklist can be found in the \\nLMS at the top of each activity.  This checklist will show you exactly what needs to be completed to finish \\neach activity. \\nStudy guides are available for students.  These guides provide chapter objectives, key chapter terms and \\ngive the answers to all the “Review Activities” at the end of the chapter.  These documents are very helpful; \\nuse them to your advantage. \\nAcademic Performance \\nYour level of accomplishment will be recognized at the end of the course with a letter grade.  Individual \\naccomplishment is measured against course standards and not against the performance of other students.  \\nLetter grades (including plus/minus) will be assigned based upon you cumulative score percentages as \\nfollows: \\nLetter Grade \\n+ \\nGrade \\n- \\n \\nVersion 4.0.0 \\nCSCI 105 - Introduction to Computers :: Online Course Syllabus \\nPage 5 of 5 \\nA \\n \\n93.3% - above \\n90.0 – 93.2% \\nB \\n86.6 – 89.9% \\n83.3 – 86.5% \\n80.0 – 83.2% \\nC \\n76.6 – 79.9% \\n73.3 – 76.5% \\n70.0 – 73.2% \\nD \\n66.6 – 69.9% \\n63.3 – 66.5% \\n60.0 – 63.2% \\nF \\n \\nBelow 60% \\n \\n \\nThe following weighting distribution will be used to compute your final grade: \\nQuizzes: \\n30% \\nAssignments: \\n40% \\nDiscussions \\n30% \\nAssessment.   \\nYour writing and programming assignments will be assessed using the writing and programming rubrics \\ndescribed in the LMS.  Individual assignments may also have their own assessment rubrics.  If this is the \\ncase, the assessment rubrics will be given to the student as part of the assignment.  Please read and \\nunderstand these rubrics as they describe the expectations for assignments as well as describe exactly how \\nthe assignments will be graded. \\nGeneral \\nIf you have a question about a grade, you should contact your instructor within one week of the day the \\ngraded work is returned to you (via the LMS).  You lose the right to re-grading after that. \\nIncompletes (a grade of “I”) are rarely granted.  The University has strict policies regarding grades of \\nincomplete.  These policies will be enforced.  Incompletes are not to be used as a shelter from potentially \\nlow grades. \\nUniversity regulations are very explicit concerning academic misconduct and cheating.  These regulations \\nwill be fully enforced.  The class policy on cheating is simple: if your work is turned in by another student, or \\nif you turn in the work of another person or persons (student or otherwise), all students involved will receive \\na zero on that assignment.  Should you cheat again, you will fail entire class and face academic misconduct \\nproceedings.  I take academic dishonesty very seriously and I expect you to take it just as seriously.  UWS \\n14.03 defines what academic misconduct is and what the penalties can be for academic misconduct.  See \\nhttp://uwp.edu/cwis/admin/policy28.htm for details. \\nAnyone who has special needs that must be accommodated to fulfill the course requirements should notify \\nthe instructor and Renee Kirby in the Office of the Educational and Career Development (WLLC D175, 595-\\n2610).  The University has many resources available to assist students with their academic studies. \\nUW Parkside Senate policy requires that this institution make reasonable accommodations for a student’s \\nreligious beliefs.  Please notify your instructor within the first two weeks of class about any scheduled class \\ndate(s) that conflict with a religious observance. \\nThe instructor reserves the right to modify this syllabus at any time, as deemed necessary.

Each problem will require that you \\ncreate several drawings as the preliminary step to developing an appropriate solution. \\nYour drawings will aid in the development of a design as well as serve as a blueprint \\nfrom which you will construct the final product. The final product (that you create) will \\ndemonstrate your understanding of the design principles and processes discussed \\nthroughout the course.  \\n            It is important that each artist (you) combines any previous knowledge, \\nexperiences and ideas with those presented in lectures, slide shows, critiques and \\ndemonstrations. The best work is produced by those students that incorporate their \\npersonality and ideas into every solution. \\n \\n2 \\n \\nGrading \\n \\nGrading is based how well you meet the given criteria, promptness, creativity, \\ncraftsmanship, and demonstrating a complete understanding of all processes and \\ntechniques. Attendance and overall attitude toward your own development are also taken \\ninto consideration when grading.   \\n \\nA. Excellent work demonstrating complete understanding of the processes and \\ntechniques required to complete the assignment. Unique and thoughtful \\ninterpretation and exemplary design solutions to the assignment. Completing all \\nrequired preparatory drawings and tests required of an assignment.

Insufficient and incomplete work and poor attendance.   \\n \\nRequirements \\n• Be on time and have all of your supplies with you. \\n• Come to class with a positive attitude and an open mind. \\n• All problems require design drawings and completed sculptures. All work must \\nbe completed by the given due date unless arrangements for an extension have \\nbeen made one week or more in advance. Late work will not be accepted any \\nlater than one week after the due date. \\n• Keep all sketches, and sculptures for the final critique. \\n• Be considerate of others by cleaning up after yourself. All tools and material left \\nout after class become the property of the sculpture room or will be thrown out. \\n \\nAttendance \\nAttendance is mandatory. You cannot learn if you are not present. This class \\nincludes visual information, demonstrations, films and slide lectures to aid in your \\ndevelopment and understanding of the course materials. If you cannot attend class please \\nask a fellow classmate about the information that you have missed. It is your \\nresponsibility to make up any class time missed.  \\nIf a class session needs to be cancelled unexpectedly due to instructor illness or \\nemergency, the instructor will notify students via UW-Parkside email. While university \\nstaff will try to post cancellation signs in the studio or classroom in a timely manner, \\nemail will be the main platform for notification.  \\n \\n3 \\n \\nArt Department Policies \\nUniversity of Wisconsin - Parkside \\nThe faculty of the Art Department at the University of Wisconsin - Parkside has \\nagreed upon the following policies.  As the faculty values the learning experience in the \\nclassroom, regular attendance in class is absolutely mandatory as well as proper \\nbehavior!  \\n  \\nAbsentee Policy \\nAfter two unexcused absences, a student's grade will be lowered; if a student in a \\nstudio course misses a critique or major demonstration, that absence will be counted \\ndouble.  Missing over nine classes without a legitimate excuse will result in course \\nfailure.  Excused absences will be granted only with a valid and documented excuse.  The \\ninstructor of the course has the final authority to determine the penalties for absences as it \\nreflects a course's distinct needs.    \\n(Passed unanimously 8/28/03) \\n \\nClassroom Conduct \\nThe Art Department also expects conduct appropriate for a university classroom \\nor studio/lab.  We have no tolerance for disrespectful behavior, which includes but is not \\nlimited to: private conversations with a classmate during a lecture or demonstration, rude \\ncomments and/or physical threats directed towards the instructor or your peers, and \\nsleeping in class.  Similarly, cell phones and pagers must be silenced before class starts, \\nfor they are disrupting to the instructor, your fellow students, and to the overall rhythm of \\nthe class.  Cheating and plagiarism will not be tolerated and will be punished to the \\nfullest extent of university policy and the law.  Each instructor also reserves the right to \\ndetermine his or her own specific classroom policies.   \\n \\nYour actions will result in a significant lowering of your grade.  The instructor \\nreserves the right to pull you aside and talk to you individually, to have you removed \\nfrom class, and to report you to the Dean of Students’ office.   \\n(Passed unanimously 1/12/06)  \\n \\nThe Art Department reserves the right to use reproductions of student work for \\npromotional purposes, including the departmental website. \\n \\nAdditional Policies \\n“Weapons are prohibited in UW-Parkside buildings and all outdoor \\nevents.  Anyone found in violation will be subject to immediate removal in addition to \\nacademic and/or legal sanctions”.  \\n \\nIt is the policy and practice of UW-Parkside to create inclusive learning \\nenvironments.  If there are aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in \\nbarriers to your inclusion, please notify me as soon as possible.

Deadlines will be \\ngiven with each assignment.  \\n \\nExams  \\nThere will be four 50-minute exams, which count approximately 100 points each. Anyone \\ninvolved in activities during an exam that suggest to the Professor or proctors that you are \\nusing unfair practices and/or outside information to increase your exam grade will have \\ntheir exam taken away and receive a zero for that exam.  \\nExam dates:  \\n• Exam #1, Wednesday, February 26 \\n• Exam #2, Wednesday, March 18  \\n• Exam #3, Friday, April 24 \\n• Exam #4 (Final Exam), FINAL: 5/13/2020 9:00AM \\n \\nIf you have more than three final examinations scheduled on May 13, and these examinations are \\nnot in the form of a team project presentation, a take-home examination or a final paper, you \\nhave the option to reschedule one of those final examinations. You must contact your college \\noffice prior to examination week to reschedule an examination. The decision as to which \\nexamination will be rescheduled is at the discretion of the college.  \\n \\nExam format:  \\nThe exams questions are multiple choice and are answered using a scantron sheet. You must \\nbring a few #2 pencils, a good eraser. The exams are scored by computer and grades are posted \\nto Canvas once the scores are received from the testing center.  \\n \\nAbsence from exams:  \\nThe only valid reasons for missing an exam are incapacitating illness or injury, death in the \\nfamily, or unavoidable absence from campus due to legal obligations (jury duty) or performance \\nin an official function of the university (i.e. athletes). In the case of emergencies such as \\nincapacitating illness or injury, you must make every effort to contact the professor as soon as \\npossible. Students must present their excuse to Dr. Bennett within one week of their return to \\nschool.  If an acceptable excuse is present, a weighted score based on the average grade on the \\nother three exams will be substituted for a missed exam.   \\n \\nAttendance \\nThe expectation is that you will attend all lectures. Attendance will not be taken on a daily basis; \\nhowever, if there is an activity (which is possible in some lectures), you will be considered \\nabsent. Because participation on these in-class activities is part of the course grade absences will \\nreduce your grade. Students missing class for University sponsored trips (i.e. athletes) should \\nsubmit their official excuse notice from the University at the beginning of the semester.  \\n \\nIn addition, it is expected that while you are in class, you are concentrating on the class.  \\nAccordingly, cell phone use is not permitted in lecture or discussions. Laptops and tablets can be \\nused only for activities directly relevant to the course. \\n \\nImportant dates related to Fall classes for Add/Drop: \\n• February 7 - last day to add without a permission number \\n• February 14 - last day to drop a class without paying a fee \\n• February 28 - last day to drop a class without a “W” placed on transcript \\n• March 20 - last day to drop a class through Solar \\n• April 24 - last day to drop a class with signed authorization from instructor, advisor, and \\nDean, and then only for extraordinary and non-academic reasons \\n \\nContacting me  \\nI encourage you to use whatever means of communication works best for you to give me \\nfeedback and ask questions. Email is probably the most reliable method, and I will try my best to \\nreply within one day. I have a special email address for this course, the one given at the \\nbeginning of the syllabus: bennettj@uwp.edu .   \\n \\nOffice Hours  \\nOffice hours will be held in my office (Greenquist 218). Office hours often get busy, so plan \\naccordingly. If you are unable to make it to my regularly scheduled office hours feel free to make \\nan appointment with me for a different time.  \\n \\nStudents with Special Needs  \\nIf you have a disability and require accommodations, please contact Dr. Bennett early in the \\nsemester so that these needs may be appropriately met. You are required to provide proof of your \\ndisability to the Disability Services office and verification to the instructor. Disability Services is \\nin WYLL D175 and staff can be reached at 595-2610 or 595-2372. \\n \\nUniversity Academic Misconduct Policy  \\nThe University’s academic misconduct policy is published in the Student Handbook (last year it \\nwas on pages 22-30) on the University website and can be accessed at: \\nhttps://www.uwp.edu/learn/departments/english/plagarism.cfm.  \\nPenalties for academic misconduct can be severe, ranging from a failing grade on the assignment to \\nsuspension or even expulsion from the University of Wisconsin System.  Students may appeal these \\npenalties following procedures outlined by UWS 14, the section of the UW  System's code on academic \\ndisciplinary policies and procedures. \\n• The instructor will determine when a student has engaged in any of the prohibited activities \\nand begin disciplinary procedures.  \\n \\nSupplemental Instruction. Supplemental instruction (SI) by student peers is available to \\neveryone in the class. This is an incredibly useful resource and has consistently been shown to \\nimprove most students’ performance! The student instructors help you review and prioritize \\nlecture topics and improve study stills. All are welcome, but those who score below a C‐ on any \\nquiz or exam are required to attend SI. Your name will be provided to the SI, who takes \\nattendance at these sessions. The SI schedule and instructors will be announced in class. \\n \\nCourse Schedule (Abbreviated) \\nDate \\n \\nSubject \\nReading  Event \\nHomewo\\nrk \\nMonday 2/3/2020 \\nGene Editing \\nNYT Article \\n \\n \\nWednesday 2/5/2020 \\nCells - Video \\n3.2  \\n \\nFriday 2/7/2020 \\nScales, cells \\n3.2 Quiz 1 \\nArticle \\nanalysis \\nMonday 2/10/2020 Organelles \\n3.5  \\nScales \\nWednesday 2/12/2020 Organelles - cytoskeleton \\n3.5  \\n  \\nFriday 2/14/2020 Bacteria \\n3.4 Quiz 2 \\n  \\nMonday 2/17/2020 \\nbacteria microbiome \\n3.4  \\nArticle \\nanalysis \\nWednesday 2/19/2020 Infectious diseases \\n13.4  \\n  \\nFriday 2/21/2020 \\nInfectious diseases \\n \\n \\nData \\nanalysis \\nMonday 2/24/2020 Life on planet Earth \\n \\n \\n \\nWednesday 2/26/2020 EXAM #1 \\n \\n \\n \\nFriday 2/28/2020 Digestion \\n5.7  \\n \\nMonday 3/2/2020 \\nATP and cellular energy \\n \\n \\n  \\nWednesday 3/4/2020 \\nFundamental chemistry \\n2.1-2.4 \\n \\nData \\nanalysis \\nFriday 3/6/2020 \\nChemistry and biochemistry \\n2.6 Quiz 3 \\n  \\nMonday 3/9/2020 \\nCell signaling \\n2.9  \\nGlucose \\nWednesday 3/11/2020 Proteins \\n2.9  \\n \\nFriday 3/13/2020 Proteins, enzymes \\n2.9, 4.4 \\n \\n  \\nMonday 3/16/2020 Lipids \\n2.8  \\n  \\nWednesday 3/18/2020 EXAM #2 \\n \\n \\n \\nFriday 3/20/2020 Introduction to genetics \\n \\n \\n \\nMar 23-27 \\n  \\n \\nSpring Break March 23 - 27 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMonday 3/30/2020 Inheritance \\nChapter 6 \\n \\n \\nWednesday 4/1/2020 \\nChromosomes and cytogenetics \\n6.3  \\n \\nFriday 4/3/2020 \\nDNA structure \\n2.1 Quiz 4 \\nData \\nanalysis \\nMonday 4/6/2020 \\nDNA replication \\n6.4  \\n  \\nWednesday 4/8/2020 \\nGene expression \\nChapter 7 \\n7.2-7.7 \\n \\n \\nFriday 4/10/2020 \\nGene expression  \\n7.2-7.2 \\nQuiz 5 \\nArticle \\nAnalysis \\nMonday 4/13/2020 Mutation \\n7.6  \\n  \\nWednesday 4/15/2020 Genetic diseases \\n9.7  \\nData \\nanalysis \\nFriday 4/17/2020 Genetic diseases \\n  \\n \\nMonday 4/20/2020 Current status of treatment \\n \\n \\n \\nWednesday 4/22/2020 EXAM #3 \\n \\n \\n \\nFriday 4/24/2020 Complex diseases \\nChapter 8 \\n \\n \\nMonday 4/27/2020 8.3 \\n  \\n \\nWednesday 4/29/2020 Genome \\n10.3  \\n  \\nFriday 5/1/2020 \\nReally coool genome stuff \\n \\n \\n \\nMonday 5/4/2020 \\nCRISPR-cas \\n \\n \\n \\nWednesday 5/6/2020 \\nCRISPR-cas \\n \\n \\nData \\nanalysis \\nFriday 5/8/2020 \\nWater and infectious disease \\n \\nQuiz 6 \\n \\nMonday 5/11/2020 Scientific paradigm \\n \\n \\n  \\nWednesday 5/13/2020 FINAL EXAM at 9:00-9:50 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\",\n",

If you have not taken a chemistry course before, you may want to take CHEM 100 \\ninstead, which will prepares you for CHEM 101. \\nCourse Overview and Goals:   \\nThis is the first semester of a two semester sequence that introduces students to the fundamental \\nconcepts and principles of chemistry. Through CHEM 101, students will be able to describe/identify: \\n(1) the fundamental building blocks of chemical systems (atoms, ions and molecules), \\n(2) variables that define chemical systems, \\n(3) reactions that simple systems can undergo, \\n(4) quantitative relations of chemical reactions, and \\n(5) the electronic structures of atoms and chemical bonding. \\nGeneral Education Learning Outcomes:   \\nChemistry 101 is a general education course in natural sciences and addresses the following goals and \\noutcomes: \\nCommunication: Literacy–reading and writing for understanding and effective communication. \\nLearning Outcome: Students will (1) comprehend vocabulary appropriately to summarize or \\nparaphrase the information, (2) apply knowledge to a variety of assignments, and (3) identify \\naspects of a text to respond to questions posed in assigned tasks.  \\nExpectations: Students are expected to read 30-40 pages per week from the textbook and lab \\nmanual.  \\nAssessment:  There will be questions in the homework and exams that require students to \\ncomprehend vocabulary, apply knowledge, and identify aspects of the text to respond.  \\n \\nReasoned Judgment: Scientific thinking–understanding and applying the scientific method. \\nLearning Outcomes:  Students can calculate (1) introductory physical and chemical properties \\nfor chemicals and chemical systems, (2) stoichiometric measures of chemical systems, and (3) \\nenergy relationships in simple chemical systems.  Successful achievement requires the correct \\nanalysis of the system to determine the relevant variables.  \\nExpectations: Skills acquired are (a) recognizes the application of the scientific method in solving \\ncontemporary problems, (b) critically evaluates information and sources, and (c) converts \\nrelevant information into various forms. \\nAssessment:  Scientific thinking is embedded and evaluated in all aspects of Chemistry 101.  \\n \\nSocial and Personal Responsibility: Individual Accountability – understanding what a responsible \\nchoice is and that one’s present education and lifelong learning is a responsibility. \\nLearning Outcome: Students successfully fulfills all aspects of the course and meets minimum \\nexpectations in problem solving. \\nExpectation:  Student identifies multiple approaches for solving the problem. Student uses skills, \\nabilities and theories gained in one situation in a new situation to contribute to the \\nunderstanding of problems or issues. Students evaluates results relative to the problem defined \\nwith some consideration of need for further work.    \\nAssessment:  Individual accountability is embedded throughout the CHEM 101 learning \\nexperience.  Lecture exercises will often involve evaluating multiple approaches and will require \\nstudents to apply prior knowledge to present (new) situations including future (further) steps.   \\nAssignments and Grading \\nGrading scale: \\n97-100% A+ \\n \\n \\n87-89% B+ \\n \\n77-79% C+ \\n \\n67-69% D+ \\n<60%F \\n93-96% A \\n \\n \\n83-86% B \\n \\n73-76% C \\n \\n63-66% D \\n90-92% A- \\n \\n \\n80-82% B- \\n \\n70-72% C- \\n \\n60-63% D- \\nGrading Categories:  \\nTextbook Homework 10% \\nWeekly Homework 20% \\nWeekly Quiz 10% \\nUnit Exams 40% \\nFinal Exam 20% \\nReading Homework: Textbook reading is required for this course. Within the text are several questions \\nto help you assess your understanding of the material. Questions are graded for correct completion by \\ndue date; unlimited attempts are allowed. Reading homework is due by 11:59pm on the days indicated \\non the calendar.  \\n \\nWeekly Homework: Several topics will be covered each week. A comprehensive homework assignment \\nthat tests your understanding of the material will be due at midnight on Wednesday via tophat.com. \\nSynchronous class periods will be used to cover similar content, however, it is recommended that you \\nattempt your homework. Two attempts are allowed per question. Once the homework is due, the \\nassignment will reopen for practice/review prior to the exams. No makeup work will be allowed.  \\n \\nWeekly Quiz: Multiple quiz questions will be embedded into each synchronous course meeting. Partial \\ncredit will be awarded for participation. At the end of the semester, the scores for this section will be \\nscaled so that 85% = 100%. No makeup work will be allowed.  \\n \\nUnit Exams: Unit exams will be administered via Respondus Lockdown browser on Canvas. Unit exams \\nwill be timed and only available for a 24 hour period. At the end of the semester, you will be invited to \\nretake your exam with the lowest score. The retake will involve new questions on the same subjects of \\nthe prior exam.  \\n \\nFinal Exam: The final exam will be administered via Respondus Lockdown browser on Canvas. You will \\nneed to have Respondus installed on your computer prior to your exam. The final exam will take place \\nduring finals week at the university-determined time. This should be considered a synchronous session.  \\n \\nAcademic Integrity Statement:  \\nNo matter your career goals, integrity will be expected. Cheating in any form will result in the following \\nrepercussions:  \\n \\n1. First offense: All parties involved receive a zero on their assignment.  \\n \\n2. Second offense: All parties will receive a grade of F in the class with no option to withdraw \\n \\nfrom the course. Students will be reported to the Dean of Students. The Dean may choose to \\n \\nexpel the student.  \\n \\nExamples of cheating include, but are not limited to: submitting another person’s work as your own, \\npaying ‘experts’ to provide answers to questions, communicating answers to questions to other \\nmembers of the class during assessments, accepting communications from other members of the class \\nduring assessments. Dr. Mann has accounts on all of the major online repositories and is tech-savvy \\nenough to find her questions when posted. Simply posting a question from one of the assessments to an \\nonline repository is grounds for punitive action.  \\n \\nExamples of cheating DO NOT include: working with partners to learn the material better, solving \\nproblems together, discussing problems, taking screenshots of problems to discuss with the instructor \\nor practice later.  \\n \\nAsynchronous content: Assignments/content are organized into easy-to-follow modules on TopHat. You \\nwill be able to access them ahead of time. Reading assignments have embedded questions. Completion \\nof both the reading and the questions is due by 11:59pm on the date that is indicated below.  \\nExams will open at 12:01am and close at 11:59pm on the day indicated below. Exams are algorithmic, \\nwhich means each student will receive a unique set of problems. Each exam must be completed within \\nan hour of the start time.  \\nSynchronous meetings: Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 11-11:53am the course will meet \\nsynchronously. Example problems will be worked, and quiz questions will be administered. If you are not \\nable to attend one of these sessions, you must provide a valid excuse and your instructor will give you a \\nmakeup assignment. After each exam, the exam questions will be recapped and correct answers will be \\nprovided with work shown.

Should technical/system-wide \\ndifficulties arise, email submissions will be timestamped, but essays will not be graded until they \\nare submitted on Canvas. \\n \\nNOTES ON PAPER COMPOSITION & GRADING \\n \\n• \\nThe grade of “C” means “average.” A low C grade (e.g. 70%) is earned if the essay successfully \\nSpring 2021 - ONLINE \\n \\n \\n4 \\nCOMM 107: Communication and the Human Condition \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nmeets all the requirements of the assignment and is competently written, but shows no or little \\nattempt to engage the material in a critical and engaging way. If the submission does not meet \\nthe minimum requirements of the assignment, students should expect a grade lower than a C. \\n \\n• \\nThe grade of “B” is earned by essays that not only meet the minimum requirements of the \\nassignment, but also attempt to move beyond simple description and into solid, well-reasoned \\nexplanation that demonstrates original thinking and coherent articulation of arguments. “B” \\nwork must engage the topic critically through careful thinking and research, resulting in a clear, \\nwell-argued submission. In addition, B papers should show some fresh, well-reasoned and \\nsupported insight into the material.  \\n \\n• \\nThe grade of “A” is reserved solely for outstanding work. To earn an A, the work must be error-\\nfree, well-written, rich in explanation and relation to the topic, demonstrate critical thinking and \\nresearch skills, and articulate an interesting and well-reasoned argument on the subject. \\n \\n• \\nGrammar counts! Although I understand the occasional typo or ill-phrased sentence, be sure to \\nproofread your work before you turn it in. “Sloppy” papers will negatively impact your grade. \\n \\n• \\nAll papers must use proper citation for any material borrowed from a source and include a \\nproper bibliography or reference page, using MLA, APA, or Chicago Style format. Consult the \\nlibrary and/or online citation resources (i.e., Purdue OWL) for citation help. There is no good \\nreason for any student’s paper not to be properly formatted. \\n \\nASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTIONS FOR WRITTEN WORK \\n \\n“Change One Thing” Essay (2-3 double-spaced pages): In this brief essay, students will explore the \\nlikely outcomes if one primary aspect of their cultural identity were different. Cultural identity can be \\ndefined in any number of ways, but students should rely on course materials for guidance on how to \\ndefine and discuss specific features of cultural identity.   \\n  \\nSuccessful papers will accomplish the following:  \\n  \\n1. Define the aspect of their cultural identity they are choosing to focus on  \\n2. At least two citations from course materials that support their characterization of cultural \\nidentity and/or the likely outcome they predict in the paper.  \\n3. Use specific examples to illustrate how their chosen aspect manifests as an element of their \\ncultural identity  \\n4. Explore key intersections between the aspect the student has opted to change about their \\ncultural identity and other aspects that remain \\n \\nCommunication Skills Report (2-3 single-spaced pages): Over the course of the semester, students will \\ncomplete two reports in which students dissect their communication behavior in actual interactions. \\nEach report will cover two different skills, each with multiple sections (detailed below), and engage \\nintercultural principles. The general objective is to practice effective interpersonal communication skills \\nwithin an intercultural context. Each section of the essay should be notated with a heading in bold. \\nEach section must have details to provide understanding to the reader and must be clear and concise – \\nbe as specific as possible, avoid generalizing.   \\n  \\n*** Please see Assignment Instructions for EACH of the skills papers on Canvas – they are \\ndifferent and address different skills. Sample essays are provided for your reference.  \\n  \\nTypographical errors, poor spelling, poor sentences, long sentences, writing as though you were \\ntalking, lack of proof reading, etc. will all contribute to a reduced grade (up to 25%). The sections for \\nSpring 2021 - ONLINE \\n \\n \\n5 \\nCOMM 107: Communication and the Human Condition \\n \\n \\n \\n \\neach essay may vary, but they generally are as follows:  \\n \\n1. Problem: Discuss the problem, behavior, or issue that you are trying to address through \\nyour interaction. Focus your attention on only one problem, behavior or issue. Provide a \\nbackground for why you chose to address this communication problem in your life, and make \\nsure the issue is one currently going on in your life.  \\n2. Person: The person that you are approaching to solve the problem. You should thoroughly \\ndescribe your relationship with them by touching on the following:   \\na. Sex/gender identity?  \\nb. Age?  \\nc. How close is this person to you? Describe the relationship (best friends, acquaintance, \\nfamily member, teacher, etc.)   \\nd. How long have you known this person? (be specific: just met - days, months, years)  \\ne. How do you communicate with this person? (phone, text, skype, email, face-to-face). \\nHow frequently do you communicate with this person? (daily once? multiple times?), \\nweekends only, monthly, when you are at home, etc.)  \\n3. Strategy employed: Explain and elaborate on the communication strategy you employed to \\nfacilitate a successful interaction. Paraphrased quotations from the interaction are useful in \\nillustrating your use of the strategy.  \\n4. Reaction: Describe the person’s reaction to what you said. Include three specific and explicit \\nemotions that the person showed during your conversation (You should reference the \\ntextbook to identify what constitutes emotions.). Strive for precise vocabulary to pinpoint \\ntheir exact emotions rather than general emotions such as “sad”, “bad”, “good”, etc. You may \\nalso describe body language as a manifestation of emotion. This section should touch on \\nintercultural influences on the interaction. \\n5. Outcome:  This is the conclusion to each skill section. It is important that you reflect on how \\nthe strategy functioned and not whether or not you or the person changed. Consider if you \\nfelt the strategy was useful and effective in this case. Also, comment on any change to your \\nrelationship with this person as a result of this interaction, positive or negative. Be sure to \\nexplain thoroughly and use specific and measurable examples from the interaction.  \\n \\nASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTIONS FOR ORAL ASSESSMENT & PARTICIPATION \\n \\nMedia Analysis (5-7 minutes):  Over the course of the semester, each class member will analyze and \\nparticipate in a class presentation on communication concepts depicted in an artifact (piece of popular \\nmedia). The chosen artifact may have audio-visual features (i.e., video clips, songs, photographs, etc.) \\nand come from mainstream or non-traditional media outlets (i.e., newspapers or periodicals, blog \\nposts, etc.). If an audio-visual text is chosen, students may opt to embed and play portions in their \\npresentation, but clips will be limited to a total maximum of one minute within the presentation.  \\n \\nIn this presentation, students will explain how a primary course concept operates within their chosen \\nartifact in order to illustrate the utility and/or limitations of that concept in understanding and \\neffectively engaging interpersonal relationships. Presentations should reflect an in-depth \\nunderstanding of both their chosen artifact and the concept it illustrates.  \\n \\nFor your participation in this assessment, you\\'ll gain greater competency with the sixth learning \\nobjective of the course: 6) To develop writing and researching skills to produce academic quality \\npapers and presentations. \\n \\nSuccessful presentations will include the following: \\nSpring 2021 - ONLINE \\n \\n \\n6 \\nCOMM 107: Communication and the Human Condition \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1. Explanation/definition of the primary course concept \\n2. Concrete examples of the course concept within the artifact. Examples should be specific and \\nevident - avoid paraphrasing, point out \"direct quotes\" \\n3. Explanation of why this particular artifact, in light of the course concept, is significant and/or \\nuseful for developing theoretical or practical knowledge on interpersonal communication \\n4. A useful handout and/or an effective slideshow that enhances the class\\' understanding of the \\narguments and ideas included in the presentation \\n \\nSpecific guidance on presentation format:  \\n \\nPresentations should be voice recorded, but it is not necessary for students to make use of a web-\\ncamera. Students are encouraged to use PowerPoint or Kaltura Capture to record their presentations. \\nDoing so will enable students to easily incorporate their visual aids and audio recording. Students are \\nalso permitted to upload mp4 audio files along with a handout or presentation file into the assignment \\ndropbox. \\n \\nClass Participation  \\nStudents will be required to participate in class activities that complement course topics and engage \\nregularly in virtual class discussions (worth up to 320 points). \\n  \\nStudents participation will constitute the completion of several online learning modules over the course \\nof the semester. Students will be assessed on the degree to which they master course concepts, \\nconstruct thoughtful arguments, and ethically engage with their instructor and peers. \\n \\nWhile I bemoan the idiosyncrasy of phrases like “common sense” or “common courtesy,” I do expect \\nstudents to adhere to these principles by suiting their behavior to the constraints of our learning \\nenvironment. Students should observe professional rules of behavior in our virtual classroom.  \\n \\nSpecifically, students should remember that they have elected to join an institution that values freedom \\nof expression and intellectual creativity, as well as diversity of beliefs and opinions. It is important to \\nremember that different people have different views of the world, and a student’s responsibility in part \\nis to be aware of and work with this diversity. Students are obliged to listen earnestly, and to remember \\nthat self-expression should always be measured with personal responsibility. Discourteous behavior will \\nbe dealt with by the instructor, including through the imposition of grade penalties as warranted. \\n \\nDetailed instructions, rubrics and due dates for assignments can be found on Canvas. \\n \\n \\nCOURSE POLICIES \\n \\nGrading Philosophy \\nGrades are awarded based on how successfully the assigned task is completed. If your work does not \\nmeet the minimum requirements for the task, then you should expect a grade less than 70% (C-) of that \\ntask’s value. If your work not only meets but clearly exceeds the minimum requirements, you should \\nexpect a grade higher than 70%. Merely completing an assigned task is not a guarantee of earning 100% \\nof the available points. Note that many of the assigned tasks for this course have multiple components to \\nthem, and the grade earned for that task is based upon an overall consideration of performance on all the \\ncomponents. \\nExpectations for Participation \\nStudents will be required to participate in discussion with their peers on relevant course concepts and \\ncase studies. Specific instructions on the expected form and content of discussion posts can be found on \\nSpring 2021 - ONLINE \\n \\n \\n7 \\nCOMM 107: Communication and the Human Condition \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCanvas in the assignment dropbox for Class Participation. \\n \\nWhile this in an online course and formal attendance will not be taken, participation in each module (1 \\nper week) and strict adherence to deadlines are priorities. Failing to submit an assignment or actively \\nparticipate in discussion within the prescribed time frame will negatively impact a student’s grade. \\nNetiquette  \\nIt is important to recognize that the online classroom is in fact a classroom, and certain behaviors are \\nexpected when you communicate with both your peers and your instructors. These guidelines for online \\nbehavior and interaction are known as netiquette.  \\nWhen posting on the Discussion Board, students should:  \\n• \\nMake posts that are on topic and within the scope of the course material  \\n• \\nTake posts seriously and review and edit all posts before submitting  \\n• \\nBe as brief as possible while still making a thorough comment  \\n• \\nAlways give proper credit when referencing or quoting another source  \\n• \\nBe sure to read all messages in a thread before replying  \\n• \\nDon’t repeat someone else’s post without adding something original to the idea/argument  \\n• \\nAvoid short, generic replies such as, “I agree.” Include reasons for agreement or add to the \\nprevious point  \\n• \\nAlways be respectful of others’ opinions even when they are unfamiliar or different  \\n• \\nWhen disagreements arise, express differing opinions in a respectful, non-critical way  \\n• \\nDo not make personal or insulting remarks  \\n• \\nBe open-minded \\nFor more information on netiquette you can refer to The Core Rules of Netiquette excerpted from the \\nbook Netiquette, by Virginia Shea. \\nLate/Missing Work \\nUnless otherwise noted, all written work should be submitted via Canvas in the appropriate dropbox \\nby 11:59p on the due date. Assignments may only be made up without penalty if the student merits an \\nexcused absence or verified extenuating circumstance (see Due Date Extensions heading below). \\n \\nIn all other cases, late assignments will accrue a deduction equaling one letter grade per day past the \\nassigned due date. An assignment is considered one day late after the posted due date. Late work \\nshould be submitted no later than one week after the missed deadline. If a student submits an \\nassignment more than one week after the due date, that student will not receive full written feedback. \\n \\nDue Date Extensions \\nIf a student is unable to submit an assignment or actively participate due to an excused absence, the \\nstudent may request permission to extend the deadline. This request should be written and include \\ndocumentation showing that the activity or emergency occurred and prevented the student’s timely \\nsubmission. Permission will be granted only in the most unusual of circumstances and students are \\nexpected to have exhausted all reasonable methods for timely submission before an extension will be \\ngranted. To be eligible for an extension, you must provide: \\n \\n• \\nWritten evidence of the absolute need to extend the deadline (emails are acceptable); \\n• \\nThis evidence must be from an appropriate, verifiable source. Documentation may include: a \\nmemo from another instructor or coach, medical excuse, proof of catastrophic technological \\nfailure, statement of military or jury service, etc.; \\nSpring 2021 - ONLINE \\n \\n \\n8 \\nCOMM 107: Communication and the Human Condition \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n• \\nEvidence must be presented to your instructor before the due date lapses. Except in cases of \\nextreme emergency, no extension will be granted when requested after the due date. \\n \\nThese requirements are necessarily strict and enforced in order to provide fairness to all class \\nparticipants. \\n \\n***As a general note, students should regularly back up their work on the cloud (Google drive or \\nDropbox), secondary hard drives, or zip drives. This is simply good practice in a digital professional \\nworld. Loss of work due to a computer glitch will not warrant an extension.  \\n \\nTechnology \\nAs all assignments will be submitted digitally, students will need regular access to the internet and basic \\ncomputing software including the Microsoft Office suite. Students should also be able to view PDF and \\nvideo files. Students may be asked to voice record submissions for consideration. \\n \\nAll written assignments and essays must be submitted in Microsoft Word, “.doc”, “.docx”, or PDF \\nformat. No other formats will be accepted. All assignments must be formatted such that they are \\naccessible without the use of internet, compatible with TurnItIn plagiarism detection software on \\nCanvas, and in a format compatible with the Microsoft Office suite. \\n \\n***The instructor will communicate with the class and/or individual students via the email address \\nlisted in their respective Canvas accounts. It is the student’s responsibility to check that email account \\nregularly.*** \\n \\nDisclaimer for Recorded and Streamed Lectures  \\nPlease note that at the instructor’s discretion, lectures and class sessions may be live streamed and/or \\nrecorded and made available to students registered for the class. The use of live streaming and lecture \\ncapture is intended to supplement the classroom experience solely for the benefit of students registered \\nin the class. UW-Parkside prohibits faculty, staff and students from copying, distributing, or using \\nlecture capture recordings for any other purpose; violation of this prohibition may be grounds for UW-\\nParkside to initiate disciplinary proceedings. \\n \\nExtra Credit \\nExtra credit may be earned through the completion of two additional Communication Skills reports. \\nThe instructions for those submissions and the dropboxes are available on Canvas. Extra credit may be \\nsubmitted at any point during the semester ahead of the last day of the class instruction.  \\n \\n \\nDEPARTMENT POLICIES \\n \\nAcademic Integrity: UW-Parkside expects all students to display honest, ethical behavior at all times \\nand under all circumstances. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to:  \\n1. Cheating. Intentionally obtaining or attempting to use unauthorized materials or information \\n(notes, texts or study aids) or unauthorized help from another person (looking at a test paper, \\nasking a question during an exam) in any work submitted for evaluation toward academic credit \\nincluding examinations, quizzes, laboratory exercises or other assignments.  \\n \\n2. Fabrication. Intentional and unauthorized falsification, invention or copying of data, practicum \\nexperience, research or laboratory findings, or bibliographic references or citations in any \\nacademic course work.  \\n \\nSpring 2021 - ONLINE \\n \\n \\n9 \\nCOMM 107: Communication and the Human Condition \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n3. Collusion. The facilitation of academic dishonesty by intentionally or knowingly providing or \\nattempting to provide any form of unauthorized help to students in violation. \\n \\n4. Plagiarism. Representing someone else’s work as your own or providing materials for such a \\nrepresentation. To avoid plagiarism, students must acknowledge the source whenever: \\na. quoting another person’s actual words; \\nb. using another person’s idea, opinion or theory; \\nc. borrowing facts, statistics or other illustrative material – unless the information is common \\nknowledge. \\n \\n5. Bribes, favors, threats. 1) Threatening, bribing, or attempting to bribe any person with the \\nintention of affecting an evaluation of academic performance; 2) conspiring to bribe or \\nthreatening a person with the intention of affecting an evaluation of academic performance.  \\n \\n6. Grade tampering. Tampering or attempting to tamper with grades.  \\n \\n7. Recycling. Re-using or duplicating work you did for another course.  \\n \\nCommunication Department Policy on Collaboration and Academic Honesty:  \\nThe Communication Department strongly encourages our students to engage in conversation and \\ncollaboration with our faculty, with each other, and with other members of the academic community. \\nThese kinds of exchanges are at the heart of teaching and learning. As part of this process, it is essential \\nthat students fully disclose and credit the sources used in their work. All work that is not originally \\ncreated by the author should be credited, including (but not limited to) others\\' ideas, language, images, \\nart, digital recordings, and projects. The intentional or unintentional use of another\\'s work, or one\\'s \\nown previous work, without the accurate and full citation of the source, constitutes plagiarism.  \\n \\nPenalties for documented cases of plagiarism may include a grade reduction or failing a course. All \\ndocumented cases of plagiarism in the Communication Department will be filed with the Department \\nChair or their designee. A student who commits two or more acts of plagiarism in one or more \\nCommunication courses will have their case reviewed by the Department\\'s Executive Committee. If a \\ncase is confirmed as constituting serious breaches of academic honesty, the committee may decide to \\nformally drop the student from the Communication Major. \\n \\n***To avoid plagiarism: If you are unfamiliar with citation styles and procedures, you should consult \\nyour instructor or a reference librarian. There are a lot of reasons why a student would be unfamiliar \\nwith the nuances of academic honesty and dishonesty, but that does not take away your responsibility \\nin this area. When in doubt, ask – there are ZERO penalties for that.*** \\n \\n \\nSTUDENT RESOURCES \\nStudent Health & Counseling Center:  \\nStudents who wish to seek counseling or other psychological services should contact the Student Health \\nand Counseling Center.  \\nAny registered student can use the services provided by the Center. Walk-in appointments are available \\nMonday - Friday for medical services. Appointments are required for all counseling visits.

       " '  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAbout the Course \\nOral interpretation is the process whereby one reads, interprets, and then performs \\ntext (literature, prose, poetry, or discourse) for an audience.  It is an artistic practice \\nthat allows one to express him/herself through the words of others.  The process \\nrequires you to become an intentional and deliberative communicator as you read \\naloud while communicating your interpretation of the text’s meaning.  Oral \\ninterpretation is NOT public speaking and NOT acting.  It lives between the two \\npractices and allows you to enhance your overall communication skills in relation to \\nspeaking in front of small or large audiences.  This process will improve your bodily \\nand vocal composure as well as your analytical and expressive skills.      \\n \\n \\nFall 2020 \\nInstructor: Dr. Adrienne Viramontes \\nEmail: viramont@uwp.edu \\nOffice Hours: All virtual. \\nal and can occur any day/time that is \\nconvenient.  Or, please make an \\nappointment. \\n \\n \\nRequired Textbook: \\n There is no required text for this course.  If I assign you to read a specific text, I \\nprovide it for you on Canvas, or you choose a text of your choice.  Please read \\nspecific directions per assignment for clarity. \\n \\n \\nGeneral Education Requirement and Learning Outcomes  \\n \\nComm 205: Oral Interpretation satisfies three credits of the humanities general \\neducation requirement.  In order for this class to be considered a general education \\ncourse, it must focus on three particular competencies: Communication, Reasoned \\nJudgment, and Social and Personal Responsibility.  Each competency is explained \\nbelow and identifies one learning outcome per competency: \\n \\nCommunication:  Comm 205 focuses on the relationship between text, \\ninterpretation, verbal and non-verbal delivery, and performance.  The main purpose \\nof the course is to enhance and improve students’ oral communication practices, \\nwhich include understanding and interpreting an author’s intentions, speaking, and \\npresenting text effectively.   Oral communication is considered to be a prepared, \\npurposeful presentation designed to increase knowledge, engage an audience, and \\nin some cases affect an audience’s values, attitudes, or behaviors.  Oral \\ninterpretation focuses more on textual and oral aesthetics and is not a form of \\n“public, persuasive speaking.” \\n \\n• Learning Outcome: Students will be able to perform oral presentations \\narticulately in academic and professional contexts. \\n \\nReasoned Judgment: Comm 205 requires students to read, interpret, and assign \\nmeaning to texts through the practice of critical thinking skills.  Critical thinking is \\ndefined as a habit of mind characterized by the comprehensive exploration of issues, \\nideas, artifacts, and events before accepting or formulating an opinion or conclusion.  \\nOral interpretation asks students to read a variety of texts and conduct research that \\ninforms the reader about social, political, and economic matrix within which that \\ntext was created, and how that particular era shaped and influenced the author.   \\nThrough that analytical process, the student develops an understanding of the text \\nconceptually, which then informs the verbal and non-verbal performance choices in \\nthe student’s performance of text for a live audience.    \\n \\n• Learning Outcome: The student will be able to historically situate, \\ninterpret, and communicate emotional meaning through the oral \\nperformance of text. \\n \\nSocial and Personal Responsibility: Comm 205 requires students to work in \\nteams and/or small groups.  Teamwork is defined as behaviors under the control of \\nindividual team members, referring specifically to the effort members put into team \\ntasks, their manner of interacting with team members, and the quantity and quality \\nof contributions they make to team discussions.     \\n \\n• Learning Outcome: Students will perform as supportive team members \\nby showing respect to others through communication and full \\ncooperation.    \\n      \\n \\nSummary of Learning Objectives  \\n \\n• Learning Outcome: Students will be able to perform oral presentations \\narticulately in academic and professional contexts. \\n \\n \\n• Learning Outcome: The student will be able to historically situate, \\ninterpret, and communicate emotional meaning through the oral \\nperformance of text. \\n \\n  \\n• Learning Outcome: Students will perform as supportive team members \\nby showing respect to others through communication and full \\ncooperation during peer reviews.    \\n \\n \\nDepartmental Learning Objectives \\nThe Communication department structures its curriculum around six learning \\nobjectives.  They are Identity, Social Justice, Knowledge, Messages, Texts, and \\nContexts.  \\n \\nThis course is directly related to the specific goals of: Identity, Knowledge, Texts, \\nand Contexts.   \\n \\nCourse Learning Goals \\n  \\nAt the end of this course, students will be able to perform a variety of texts \\nthat engage an audience through the use of their voice and body. \\n \\nStudents will realize how the body, voice, and facial expressions have the \\npower to communicate particular emotions, intentions, and meanings. \\n \\nCommunication Department Learning Objectives \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCourse Policies \\nAny student with a documented disability who needs academic adjustments or \\naccommodations is requested to speak with me during the first two weeks of class. \\nAll discussions will remain confidential. Students with disabilities should also \\ncontact Disability Services in WYLL D175 at 595-2372 or 595-2610.  \\n \\nClass Requirements: \\n \\n3 Oral Interpretation Performances    \\n \\n \\n \\n100 points each \\nIntro Video    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n10 points \\nRead Alouds  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n10 points each \\nPicture Portrayal \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n10 points \\nVideo Reflection \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n5 points each \\nLip Sync \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n30 points \\nSlam Poetry  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n50 points \\nSlam Poetry Analysis  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n50 points \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nTotal   \\n \\nAll Assignment due dates are located in the Calendar section on Canvas.  \\n \\nAssignment Descriptions  \\n \\nPerformances of Text: \\nAll performances of text will require that you capture it on video to post online in \\neither a drop box or discussion board.

I \\nask that you read aloud sometimes on video because I want to see your body \\nlanguage in relation to your reading of text.  All texts are written to be read aloud \\nand doing so teaches us how grammar actually works, and how words, when \\nconnected in sentences, represent complete thoughts.  Practicing how to \\ncommunicate complete thoughts improves reading and speaking skills in general.   \\nThese reading aloud assignments are vocal exercises that allow us to practice \\nparalinguistic and non-verbal communication which help to foster the relationship \\nbetween text, verbal, and non-verbal communication.  These exercises will be in \\nvideo or audio format and uploaded onto the D2L site.  I will specify where to put \\nthem; either in the drop box or discussion board.  \\n \\nIntroduction videos.   \\nCreate a video recording of you introducing yourself to our class.  Make sure you are \\nstanding so we can see all (or at least, most) of you.   Make sure you include the \\nfollowing information: \\n• Your full name, and how you would like for me or others to address you \\n(nickname, shorter version of long name, totally different name, etc.) \\n• The last thing you read (that you enjoyed).  What was it (book, magazine, \\nnewspaper, etc)?  Who wrote it?  If nothing, then explain why you hate \\nreading.    \\n• What is your major and why?  What would you like to do when you are finished \\nwith college? \\n• End by answering this question:  Ask someone who knows you what he or she \\nthinks is significant about the way you communicate.  What stands out to \\nthem?  What are some of your communication habits?    \\nThis assignment is worth 10 points.  Please upload your video to the appropriate \\ndiscussion board. \\n \\nPlease post to the discussion section so that your classmates can meet you! \\n \\nTentative Weekly Schedule \\n \\nWeek 1 \\n9/2 – 9/4 \\nPlease watch short introduction video.

After the 48 hours, and points may be \\ndeducted. \\n \\nIf you experience a hardship that causes you to miss deadlines, please contact me and your \\nadviser.  I don’t want to know anyone’s private or medical information –  the adviser will send \\nan email and I’ll try to make accommodations and inform you of your options so you can make \\ngood decisions. \\n \\nStudents with a Disability. Anyone who has special needs that must be accommodated to fulfill \\nthe course requirements should notify the instructor and Renee Kirby in the Office of the \\nEducational and Career Development (WLLC D175, 595-2610). The University has many \\nresources available to assist students with their academic studies.  \\n \\nAccommodation of Religious Observances. UW Parkside Senate policy requires that this \\ninstitution make reasonable accommodations for a student’s religious beliefs. Please notify your \\ninstructor within the first two weeks of class about any scheduled class date(s) that conflict with \\na religious observance. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2 \\nLEARNING OUTCOMES: \\n \\nTo learn the how professionals in the field collect and analyze data. \\n \\nTo develop an Understanding of the Three Parts of the Criminal Justice System \\n \\nTo learn basic definitions and terms used by professionals within the Criminal Justice System. \\n \\nTo develop a knowledge base concerning policies and procedures in the Criminal Justice System. \\n \\nTo learn the basic responsibilities and limits of power of specific organizations within the \\nCriminal Justice System. \\n \\nTo develop an understanding of how the parts of the system interact with one another. \\n \\nTo develop an appreciation of the importance of the Rule of Law \\n \\nTo develop an understanding of Due Process as a cornerstone of civil society \\n \\n \\nMATERIAL INVENTORY: \\n \\nEssentials of Criminal Justice 11th edition, Siegel and Sienna \\n \\nStudents will be writing and submitting 5 written assignments of at least 3 pages (each) in length.  \\nThe papers will summarize and review information from various internet sites.  The papers \\nshould be written in the third person, conform to an accepted standard academic format (MLA, \\nAPA, Etc.) \\n \\nPapers are due on the date  listed below.  More specific evaluation criteria/guidelines are on the \\nlast page of this syllabus. You should respond to the discussion boards with 1-3 paragraphs of \\ncontent and comment on the responses posted by two other students. \\n \\nWe will also use various web sites for weekly assignments, video presentations and possibly \\nguest speakers. \\n \\nGrading:   \\n60% of your grade is based on 5 (3 page) papers. \\n \\n \\n10% of your grade is based on 1 tests  \\n \\n \\n30% of your grade is based on 5 on-line discussions \\n \\nOn-Line Conduct: \\n \\nEveryone should always engage in behavior and make statements that foster an atmosphere of \\nmutual respect.  If you disagree with someone or disagree with their evidence – keep it civil; \\ntreat others the way you wish to be treated.  \\n \\nIf other issues arise, please contact me so that they may be resolved quickly.   \\n \\n3 \\n \\nAcademic Honesty/Integrity: \\n \\nUnless authorized by your instructor, you are expected to complete all assignments, including \\nhomework and exams, without assistance from any source. You are expected to develop original \\nwork for this course; therefore, you may not submit course work you completed for another \\ncourse to satisfy the requirements for this course.  \\n \\nWhile it has not happened much in my career, I can honestly say that when it has come up, it is \\nan unpleasant experience. It is simply not worth the risk.  In many instances, we can work with a \\nstudent who is struggling with issues and make accommodations so they can get through the \\nsemester – there is no room to work with someone if they resort to cheating.   \\n \\n \\nCourse Assignments: \\n \\nDetailed instructions and criteria for the papers will be provided for the first assignment.  The \\ncriteria for the papers if also listed below.  \\n \\nThe assignments listed below in this course will be used as tools for learning and for assessment \\nof participant familiarity and relative mastery of the theories, concepts, and skills/strategies \\npresented in the course.  Have the materials prepared by the date specified in the syllabus.   \\n \\n \\nASSIGNMENTS/PAPERS/ \\n \\nCourse Assignments \\n \\nWeek Assignments \\nDue Date \\n1 \\nIntroductions, Syllabus \\nChapter 1, Crime and Justice \\nChapter 2, The Nature of Crime and Victimization. \\n \\nDiscussion 1: Please introduce yourself on the discussion board \\nand mention two things that you’d really like to learn in this class \\n– not just “How the Criminal Justice System Works” but \\nsomething deeper. \\n \\n \\n \\nSept 4 \\n2 \\nChapter 3: Criminal Law: Substance and Procedure \\nAssignment 1, a Three Page Paper is Due. The intent of this paper \\nis to have the students read a portion of the FBI’s Uniform Crime \\nReporting handbook so they can learn about the standards of data \\nclassification, scoring and reporting. The FBI compiles data from \\nover 17,000 law enforcement agencies every year. There has to \\nSept 11 \\n \\n4 \\nbe procedures so everyone is collecting and reporting information \\nin the same way - hence the term \"uniform\". \\n Each student will read and review Chapters 1 an 2 of the attached \\nfile and write a three page report.  How does the FBI define, \\ncount, mandate reporting on crime? What rules or guidelines \\napply to various circumstances? \\n \\n3 \\nChapter 4: Police in Society: History and Organization \\n \\nDiscussion 2: These have been difficult times, but we’ve had \\nother turbulent times. Read the article “Civil Disturbances \\nAttributed to Police Misuse of Force” and respond with 1-3 \\nparagraphs and then comment on the responses of two other \\nstudents. This article is about non-violent protest and all-out riots \\nand some context as to what happened. I’m obviously against \\nviolence and property crimes but it is important to understand our \\npast to make a better future. \\n \\n \\nSept 18 \\n4 \\nChapter 5: The Police: Role and Function \\n \\n \\nSept 25 \\n5 \\nChapter 6: Issues in Policing: Professional, Social, and Legal \\n \\nAssignment 2: FBI and the Freedom of Information Act Reading \\nRoom \\nhttp://www.fbi.gov/foia/ \\n \\nThe Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a law ensuring public \\naccess to U.S. government records. FOIA carries a presumption \\nof disclosure; the burden is on the government - not the public - \\nto substantiate why information may not be released. Upon \\nwritten request, agencies of the United States government are \\nrequired to disclose those records, unless they can be lawfully \\nwithheld from disclosure under a lawful exemption in the FOIA.  \\n \\nYour assignment is to select a case or a file, read it and write \\nabout it – that is to say, summarize the content.  You may have to \\nlook at more than one file to get the right amount of information \\n(3 pages) as some files are very long and some are very short. \\n \\nThere are interesting and strange things in these files: celebrities, \\nwell-know criminal events or cases and some very strange things \\nlike files on UFO’s.  You may choose any of them to write about. \\nOct 2 \\n \\n5 \\n \\n6 \\nChapter 7 Courts, Prosecution, and Defense \\n \\nDiscussion 3 – Thinking About the “How” of What the Criminal \\nJustice System Does, Tracey L.

On a tragic day in 1967, \\nAmerican soldiers entered a village in Vietnam and murdered \\nas many as 500 civilians. This assignment is about the military \\njustice system, the war, the political struggles at home. See \\nthe instructions on Canvas, you’ll a write three page paper. \\n \\nOct 23 \\n9 \\nChapter 10, Community Corrections \\n \\nDiscussion 4: Reaction and discussion of the My Lai assignment. \\nWhat were your thoughts and feelings?

    "\n",
    "Further Work: We can create topics based on the manual HIP work done on the 60 odd documents. We have keywords from that work of study and that can be used in some combination with this to go further into the work done here to get better results. Document summarization can also be looked into along with word embeddings in combination with Topic Modelling.\n",
